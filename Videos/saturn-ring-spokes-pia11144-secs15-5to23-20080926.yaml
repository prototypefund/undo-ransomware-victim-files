  {{Information
  |Description=Dark spokes dance around [[:en:Saturn|Saturn]]'s [[:en:B Ring|B ring]] in this series of movies comprised of images taken with [[:en:Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]]'s wide-angle camera.
  
  This full size animation is from the sequence taken on {{ISOdate|2008-09-26}}: 15.5 to 23 seconds extracted from a concatenation of spoke movies acquired by NASA's Cassini spacecraft.
  
  As Saturn nears [[:en:equinox|equinox]] in August 2009 and the sun angle on the ring plane decreases, spokes become common sights in Cassini images, just as they were in [[:en:Voyager program|Voyager]] images. The planet's [[:en:orbital period|orbital period]] is 29.5 years, so Saturn has nearly made one complete trip around the sun since the flybys of the two Voyager spacecraft in 1980 and 1981, allowing Cassini to closely match Voyager's viewing geometry.
  
  This movie shows the sunlit side of the rings at low solar phase, or spacecraft-rings-sun, angles. The spokes appear dark against Saturn's B ring at low phase angles because the particles within them scatter light more efficiently in the forward direction (away from Cassini) than the surrounding larger ring particles. In the opposite viewing geometry, at high phase angles, spokes appear bright relative to surrounding ring particles.
