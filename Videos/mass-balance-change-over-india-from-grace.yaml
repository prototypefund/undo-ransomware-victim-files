  {{Information
  |Description    ={{en|1=This animation shows the average yearly change in mass, in cm of [[water]], during 2003-2010, over the [[:en:Indian subcontinent|Indian subcontinent]]. The yellow circles mark locations of glaciers. There is significant mass loss in this region (denoted by the blue and purple colors), but it is concentrated over the plains south of the glaciers, and is caused by groundwater depletion. A colorbar overlay shows the range of values displayed. }}
