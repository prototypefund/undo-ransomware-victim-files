  {{Information
  | Description = Above the forest line in the Southern Alps in the South Island of New Zealand are extensive areas partly covered in scrub and tussock, partly bare rocks and shingle, and mostly precipitous and difficult to traverse. This entire region is exposed to an unforgiving mountainous climate, snow and bleak winds in winter, mist and wind in summer. It is here, and in the upper margins of the beech forest, that the Kea, the worldâ€™s only mountain parrot, has evolved a level of intelligence that rivals that of the most sophisticated monkeys.
