  {{Information
  |Description    ={{en|1=An example of a mathematics question on a test like the SAT reasoning test. In this instance, test-takers would be asked to figure out the answer, possibly by guessing, or possibly by using algebra. One might find that x is 3 and y is 11. Accordingly, 55 x 3 => 165, and then 165 + 11 => 176, and so on down the line. So the answer, 14, should be written in the grid-space box. This type of question on the SAT reasoning test has been termed a "grid-in" question.}}
