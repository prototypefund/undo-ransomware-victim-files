  {{Information
  |description={{en|1=A visual timeline of the seven Wonders of the ancient world.
  
  In green, the date as of which the wonder's construction ''began''.
  In red, the date (or timespan) of the wonder's destruction.
  In yellow, the narrow window (247 BC – 226 BC) in which all seven wonders were completed and standing.
  
  The temple of Artemis was destroyed on a see ( at Herostratus), rebuilt (starting 323 BC), and destroyed once more by the Goths roughly 600 years later.
  
  The Colossus of Rhodes collapsed following an earthquake, but the statue's remains were left untouched – for religious reasons – for nearly a millenium. In 654 AD Muslim caliph Muawiyah I looted the remains, selling them to a jewish merchant who broke them in pieces and carried them away with 900 camels.
