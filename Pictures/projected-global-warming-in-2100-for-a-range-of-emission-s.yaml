  {{Information
  |description={{en|1=This graph shows projected increases in global mean temperature (relative to [[:en:Pre-industrial society|pre-industrial]] times) in the year 2100, for a range of scenarios. Pre-industrial times are approximated as the years 1850 to 1900. 7 sets of temperature projections are given for different [[:en:Earthâ€™s atmosphere|atmospheric]] concentrations of greenhouse gases (measured in parts per million of carbon dioxide equivalents) in the year 2100. On the graph, the dark grey area of the bar shows 10th to 90th percentile range of median estimates, while the light grey area of the bar shows the 16th to 84th percentile range of the full distribution of results. Graph data is tabulated in a later [[:File:Projected global warming in 2100 for a range of emission scenarios.png#Data|section]].
