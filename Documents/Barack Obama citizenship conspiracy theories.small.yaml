The Barack Obama campaign posted the same Certification of Live Birth image on its own website, labeling it as a "Birth Certificate" to counter rumors against the candidate. This larger version, retreived from the Daily Kos website provides more detail. The Daily Kos is reliable enough to post a copy of a document which looks identical to the one on the Barack Obama campaign website at http://my.barackobama.com/page/invite/birthcert
