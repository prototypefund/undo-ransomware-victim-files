Korea Aerospace Research Institute
    • Prior to South Korea's entry into the IAE in 1992, it focused primarily on aerospace technology.
    • The Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) established in 1989, is the aeronautics and space agency of Republic of Korea(South Korea).
The Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) established in 1989, is the aeronautics and space agency of Republic of Korea(South Korea).  Its main laboratories are located in Daejeon, in the Daedeok Science Town. KARI's vision is to continue building upon indigenous launch capabilities, strengthen national safety and public service, industrialize satellite information and applications technology, explore the moon, and develop environmentally-friendly and highly-efficient cutting-edge aircraft and core aerospace technology.  Current projects include the KSLV-2 launcher. Past projects include the 1999 Arirang-1 satellite.  The agency was founded in 1989.  Prior to South Korea's entry into the IAE in 1992, it focused primarily on aerospace technology.

Space Launch Vehicles
KSLV-1 and KSLV-2
    • South Korea is planning to launch its next rocket KSLV-2 by year 2019.
    • KSLV-1 was the most prominent project of the whole South Korean space development program and was successfully launched in late January 2013.
    • After several failed attempts, KARI turned to Russia's Khrunichev Design Bureau for assistance in developing a liquid-propellant rocket engine for the KSLV-1 as well as for cooperation in the construction of the launch facility at the Naro Space Center.
KSLV-1 launched on August 25, 2009. It was originally a cluster indigenous liquid KSR-III rockets with a solid propellant to form a multistage launcher. However, KARI experienced more difficulties than expected in SLV development, because it required much stronger propellant power than KSR-III possessed to launch a satellite into orbit. After several failed attempts, KARI turned to Russia's Khrunichev Design Bureau for assistance in developing a liquid-propellant rocket engine for the KSLV-1 as well as for cooperation in the construction of the launch facility at the Naro Space Center. KSLV-1 was transformed into a two-stage launcher, 33 m high with a maximum diameter of 2.9 m. It has a mass of 140 tons at lift-off. The first stage of the launcher was derived from the Russian URM-1 (Universal Rocket Module) developed by Khrunichev. The second stage of the launcher was a solid Kick Motor developed by Korea, which includes the Inertial Navigation System; the power, control, and flight safety systems; plus the nose fairing. KSLV-1 was the most prominent project of the whole South Korean space development program and was successfully launched in late January 2013. 
South Korea is planning to launch its next rocket KSLV-2 by year 2019. The first stage of its rocket will have 4 clustered engines, each of which will have a 75 metric ton thrust. It was announced that KARI has already developed few prototypes of a 75 metric ton thrust engine.
KSLV-2 TLV
    • The Test Launch Vehicle (TLV) is a two stages rocket used to test the performance of the 75-tons and 7-tons thrust rocket engines that will power the KSLV-2.
    • The main-stage Kerolox engine is fully gimballed.
The Test Launch Vehicle (TLV) is a two stages rocket used to test the performance of the 75-tons and 7-tons thrust rocket engines that will power the KSLV-2. 
The TLV is 25.8 meters in length, 2.6 meters in diameter, and with a mass of 52.1 tons. The main-stage Kerolox engine is fully gimballed.

Test flight #1
    • The first TLV was launched from the Naro Space Center in Goheung, South Jeolla Province.
    • The launch of the first TLV while deemed successful with its main engine burning for 151 seconds in a 10 minute flight, was not broadcast live.
The first TLV was launched from the Naro Space Center in Goheung, South Jeolla Province. 
The main objective of the first suborbital flight was for the  single-stage rocket's main engine to burn 140 seconds, reaching a 100 km altitude before splashing down in the sea between Jeju Island and Okinawa Island.
The maiden flight was first delayed from October 25, 2018, for two months, due to abnormal readings detected in the rocket propellant pressurization system.
The test flight was then rescheduled for November 28, 2018, at 16:00 KST(UTC+9). No payload is to be placed into orbit.
The launch of the first TLV while deemed successful with its main engine burning for 151 seconds in a 10 minute flight, was not broadcast live.
After reaching a maximum suborbital altitude of 209 kilometers, the rocket stage hit the ocean 429 kilometers southeast of Jeju.
KSLV-3
    • Due to the development of the Small launch vehicle (SSLV), KSLV-III is changed to GEO-SLV, whith a payload of 3t to GEO.
    • KSLV-3 was initially designed to launch geostationary satellites of 6 tons, and to enter service in 2023.

Engines development
    • The second stage will be powered by a KRE-90V staged combustion cycle engine.
    • KRE-010V, the Korean staged combustion cycle engine of 10 tons thrust had a 100 second burn test on December 6th, 2018.
    • It will be used as the upper stage (3rd stage) engine of KSLV-III.
The core stage will powered by four KRE-90 engines of 90 tons thrust, plus four liquid boosters each with a KRE-90 engine. The second stage will be powered by a KRE-90V staged combustion cycle engine.
KRE-010V, the Korean staged combustion cycle engine of 10 tons thrust had a 100 second burn test on December 6th, 2018. It will be used as the upper stage (3rd stage) engine of KSLV-III.

KSLV-4
    • KSLV-4 was expected to carry the 64-tons class space station's modules.
    • Due to the development of the Small launch vehicle (SSLV), KSLV-IV will be no longer be developed.
KSLV-4 was expected to carry the 64-tons class space station's modules. KSLV-4 scheduled to enter service in 2028 (updated plan).
Due to the development of the Small launch vehicle (SSLV), KSLV-IV will be no longer be developed.
Small launch vehicle (SSLV)
    • By 2025 it should be able to put a payload of less than 500kg to LEO.

Korean Lunar Exploration Program
    • Phase 2 will include a lunar obiter, a lunar lander, and a rover to be launched together on a KSLV-II South Korean rocket from the Naro Space Center, in 2025.
    • Phase 1 incorporates the launch and operation of a lunar orbiter called Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter (KPLO), which will be the first lunar probe by South Korea, meant to develop and enhance South Korea's technological capabilities, as well as map natural resources from orbit.
In December 2016, KARI signed a lunar exploration technical cooperation with NASA which increased the possibility of exploration success greatly. The Korean Lunar Exploration Program (KLEP) is divided in two phases. Phase 1 incorporates the launch and operation of a lunar orbiter called Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter (KPLO), which will be the first lunar probe by South Korea, meant to develop and enhance South Korea's technological capabilities, as well as map natural resources from orbit. Phase 2 will include a lunar obiter, a lunar lander, and a rover to be launched together on a KSLV-II South Korean rocket from the Naro Space Center, in 2025.

    • Korea is expected to become the only seventh country  in the world to own an SBAS, beginning in July 2020.
    • This technological achievement is a prerequisite for Korea joining the G7.
    • KASS is the Korean model of satellite-based augmented systems (SBAS), a technology that is capable of reducing GPS error to less than 3m.
