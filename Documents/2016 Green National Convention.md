Jill Stein began taking part in the 2016 Green Party presidential
primaries in February 2016. Stein was immediately the front-runner and
was described by the media as "steamrolling to victory." On June 15,
2016, the Stein campaign announced that it had received 203 delegates,
enough to win the nomination on the first ballot at the 2016 Green
National Convention. A week before the start of the convention, former
Ohio State Senator Nina Turner, who served as a surrogate for Senator
Bernie Sanders during his campaign, announced that she had been in
discussions with the Stein campaign about possibly serving as Stein's
vice presidential pick. The following day, Stein stated that the
campaign hadn't chosen a VP candidate yet, and was in discussion with
several individuals. On August 1, the Stein campaign announced that
Ajamu Baraka had been chosen as Stein's VP candidate. Stein released the
names of the final six individuals she had considered as her running
mate, with Baraka being the choice. The six contenders for Stein's
running mate were:

Ajamu Baraka, founding executive director of the US Human Rights Network
and associate fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies

Party
