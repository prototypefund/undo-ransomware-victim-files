Near Earth Network
==================

-   *\
    The Near Earth Network (NEN, formerly GN or Ground Network) provides
    orbital communications support for near-Earth orbiting customer
    platforms via various ground stationns, operated by NASA and other
    space agencies.*

-   *The NEN and SN combined were previously referred to as the
    Spaceflight Tracking and Data Network (STDN).*

The Near Earth Network (NEN, formerly GN or Ground Network) provides
orbital communications support for near-Earth orbiting customer
platforms via various ground stationns, operated by NASA and other space
agencies. It uses a number of different dishes scattered around the
globe. The antennas must be able to move fast for tracking of objects in
low earth orbit (LEO). The NEN and SN combined were previously referred
to as the Spaceflight Tracking and Data Network (STDN).

Ground stations
===============

-   *NEN uses Stations run by SSC — Swedish Space Corporation*

-   *Space US North Pole, Alaska— Supports: S/X Band — Assets:
    5m/7.3m/11m/13m*

-   *Space US South Point, Hawai — Supports: S/X Band — Assets: 13m/13m*

-   *SSC Space US Dongara, Australia — Supports: S/X Band — Assets: 13m*

-   *Svalbard Satellite Station Norway — Supports: S/X Band — Assets:
    11.3m/11.3m/13m*

NEN uses several stations run by NASA:

Alaska Satellite Facility in Fairbanks, Alaska— Supports: S/X Band —
Assets: 11.3m/11m/9.1m

Kennedy Uplink Station, Merritt Island Launch Annex (MILA)— Supports:
S-band - Assets: 6.1m

McMurdo, Antarctica— Supports: S/X Band — Assets: 10m

Ponce de Leon Station, Florida — Supports: S-band - Assets: 6.1m

Wallops Ground Station, in Wallops Island, Virginia— Supports: VHF, S/X
Band — Assets: 11m/5m

White Sands Ground Station, New Mexico — Supports: VHF, S/Ka Band —
Assets: 18.3m

NEN uses Stations run by KSAT — Kongsberg Satellite Services:

Singapore, Malaysia — Supports: S/X Band — Assets: 9.1m

Svalbard Satellite Station Norway — Supports: S/X Band — Assets:
11.3m/11.3m/13m

TrollSat, Antarctica — Supports: S/X Band — Assets: 7.3m/7.3m

NEN uses a Station run by SANSA — South African National Space Agency:

Hartebeesthoek, South Africa — Supports: S/X Band — Assets: 12m/10m

NEN uses Stations run by SSC — Swedish Space Corporation

Kiruna, Sweden — Supports: S/X Band — Assets: 13m/13m

Santiago, Chile— Supports: S Band — Assets: 9m/12m/13m

Space US North Pole, Alaska— Supports: S/X Band — Assets:
5m/7.3m/11m/13m

SSC Space US Dongara, Australia — Supports: S/X Band — Assets: 13m

Space US South Point, Hawai — Supports: S/X Band — Assets: 13m/13m

Also under contract was Poker Flat Research Range. Additionally, the
MILA and Wallops stations provide pre-launch, launch, and landing
communications support for the Space Shuttle program.

Authority and responsibility
============================

-   *The Goddard Space Flight Center Ground Network Project has
    responsibility for maintaining the NEN, as well as implementing the
    Satellite laser ranging (SLR) Network.*

-   *The NEN falls under NASA's SOMD (Space Operations Mission
    Directorate), interoperating with the SCaN Program offices.*

The NEN falls under NASA's SOMD (Space Operations Mission Directorate),
interoperating with the SCaN Program offices. The Goddard Space Flight

Support for Constellation
=========================

-   *The NEN was slated to support the Constellation Program, including
    the Ares launch vehicle, NISN (NASA Integrated Services Network),
    FDF (Flight Dynamics Facilities), KSC Launch Control Center, and the
    Constellation Mission Control Center (MCC).*

The NEN was slated to support the Constellation Program, including the
Ares launch vehicle, NISN (NASA Integrated Services Network), FDF
(Flight Dynamics Facilities), KSC Launch Control Center, and the
Constellation Mission Control Center (MCC). Constellation has since been
canceled.
