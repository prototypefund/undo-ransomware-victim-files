Bakhtiari dialect is a dialect of Southern Luri spoken by Bakhtiari
people in Chaharmahal-o-Bakhtiari, Bushehr, eastern Khuzestan and parts
of Isfahan and Lorestan provinces. It is closely related to the
Boir-Aḥmadī, Kohgīlūya, and Mamasanī dialects in northwestern Fars.
These dialects, together with the Lori dialects of Lorestan (e.g.
Khorramabadi dialect), are referred to as the “Perside” southern Zagros
group, or Lori dialects.\
\
"Luri and Bakhtiari are much more closely related to Persian, than
Kurdish." The Bakhtiari dialect is considered a middle Persian dialect
which could survive through history. There do exist transitional
dialects between Southern Kurdish and Lori-Bakhtiāri', and
Lori-Bakhtiāri itself may be called a transitional idiom between Kurdish
and Persian, with most of the language originating from Persian.
