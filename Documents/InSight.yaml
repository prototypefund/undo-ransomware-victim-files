  In this photo, the back shell of NASA's InSight spacecraft is being lowered onto the mission's lander, which is folded into its stowed configuration. The back shell and a heat shield form the aeroshell, which will protect the lander as the spacecraft plunges into the upper atmosphere of Mars. The photo was taken on April 29, 2015, in a spacecraft assembly clean room at Lockheed Martin Space Systems, Denver.
  
  InSight, for Interior Exploration Using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport, is scheduled for launch in March 2016 and landing in September 2016. It will study the deep interior of Mars to advance understanding of the early history of all rocky planets, including Earth.

  PI/Engineer: Gary V. Latham, Marine Biomedical Institute/Galveston, TX
  Other Contacts: Maurice Ewing, Frank Press
  
  Apollo Flight Nos.: 11, 12, 14, 15, 16
  Apollo Exp't No. S 031
  
  Discipline: lunar seismometry
  
  Weight: 11.5 kg (A-12, 14-16) 47.7 kg (A-11)
  
  Dimensions:
  23 cm dia., 29 cm high; thermal skirt extended to 1.5 m dia.
  
  Manufacturer: Teledyne, Bendix
  
  Description/Purpose:
  The instrument consisted of a seismometer designed to detect moonquakes and impacts. It was considered part of the EASEP on A-11. It contained 3 long-period seismometers with resonant periods of ~15 seconds, aligned orthogonally to measure surface motion in 3 dimensions, and a single-axis, short period seismometer sensitive to vertical motion at higher frequencies (resonant period of ~1 sec.) On later ALSEPs, the single vertical sensor frequency was 0.05 to 10 Hz and the 3 orthogonal sensors were sensitive to 0.004 to 3 Hz. It sat on a mounting stool, which raised the unit off the surface. A Mylar skirt surrounded the unit to reduce thermally induced tilts of the local surface around the apparatus. The A-11 instrument was powered by solar panels, the rest by the ALSEP RTG.

  InSight, short for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport, is designed to give the Red Planet its first thorough check up since it formed 4.5 billion years ago. The mission will look for tectonic activity and meteorite impacts, study how much heat is still flowing through the planet, and track Mars' wobble as it orbits the sun. While InSight is a Mars mission, it's more than a Mars mission. InSight will help answer key questions about the formation of the rocky planets of the solar system.

  |description={{en|1=PIA17358: Artist's Concept of InSight Lander on Mars 
  
  http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17358
  
  This artist's concept depicts the stationary NASA Mars lander known by the acronym InSight at work studying the interior of Mars. The InSight mission (for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport) is scheduled to launch in March 2016 and land on Mars six months later. It will investigate processes that formed and shaped Mars and will help scientists better understand the evolution of our inner solar system's rocky planets, including Earth.
  
  InSight will deploy two instruments to the ground using a robotic arm: a seismometer (contributed by the French space agency Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales, or CNES) to measure the microscopic ground motions from distant marsquakes, providing detailed information about the interior structure of Mars; and a heat-flow probe (contributed by the German Aerospace Center, or DLR) designed to hammer itself 3 to 5 meters (about 16 feet) deep and monitor heat coming from the planet's interior. The mission will also track the lander's radio to measure wobbles in the planet's rotation that relate to the size of its core and will include a camera and a suite of environmental sensors to monitor the weather and variations in the magnetic field. Lockheed Martin Space Systems, Denver, is building the spacecraft.
  
  The following are shown in the annotated image:
  
    • Grapple – Mechanism at the end of the IDA that grips the instruments during deployment<br>
    • Heat Flow Probe – Hammering mechanism that pulls the temperature sensors down into the regolith<br>
    • HP3 – Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, the heat flow experiment<br>
    • IDC – Instrument Deployment Camera, pointable medium-resolution camera<br>
    • IDA – Instrument Deployment Arm<br>
    • ICC – Instrument Context Camera, fixed wide-angle camera<br>
    • Pressure Inlet – Wind-shielded opening for pressure sensor<br>
    • RISE Antenna – X-band radio antenna for the Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment<br>
    • SEIS – Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure, the seismometer<br>
    • Tethers – Cables carrying electrical power, commands and data between the lander and instruments<br>
    • TWINS – Temperature and Winds for InSight, environmental sensors<br>
    • UHF Antenna – Antenna used for communication with orbital relay spacecraft<br>
    • WTS – Wind and Thermal Shield protecting the seismometer from the environment<br>

  {{Information
  |description={{en|1=PIA22957: InSight Collecting Mars Weather Data (Artist's Concept) 
  
  This artist's concept shows NASA's InSight lander with its instruments deployed on the Martian surface. InSight's package of weather sensors, called the Auxiliary Payload Subsystem (APSS), includes an air pressure sensor inside the lander -- its inlet is visible on InSight's deck -- and two air temperature and wind sensors on the deck. Under the deck's edge is a magnetometer, provided by UCLA, to measure changes in the local magnetic field that could also influence SEIS.
  
  InSight's air temperature and wind sensors are actually refurbished spares built for Curiosity's Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS). Called Temperature and Wind for InSight, or TWINS, these two east- and west-facing booms sit on the lander's deck and were provided by Spain's Centro de Astrobiología (CAB).
  
  JPL manages InSight for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. InSight is part of NASA's Discovery Program, managed by the agency's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Lockheed Martin Space in Denver built the InSight spacecraft, including its cruise stage and lander, and supports spacecraft operations for the mission.
  
  A number of European partners, including France's Centre National d'Études Spatiales (CNES) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR), are supporting the InSight mission. CNES and the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris (IPGP) provided the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) instrument, with significant contributions from the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS) in Germany, the Swiss Institute of Technology (ETH) in Switzerland, Imperial College and Oxford University in the United Kingdom, and JPL. DLR provided the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (HP3) instrument, with significant contributions from the Space Research Center (CBK) of the Polish Academy of Sciences and Astronika in Poland. Spain's Centro de Astrobiología (CAB) supplied the wind sensors.
