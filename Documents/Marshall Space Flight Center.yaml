  |description={{en|1=A concept of a possible Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) built by the Grumman Industries for NASAâ€™s Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), this Mobility Test Article (MTA) is undergoing a full fledged test, complete with space suit attire. The data provided by the MTA helped in designing the LRV, developed under the direction of MSFC. The LRV was designed to allow Apollo astronauts a greater range of mobility during lunar exploration missions.

  |description={{en|1=The Serpentuator is a 40-foot long articulated arm to aid astronauts on [[:en:extra-vehicular activity|extra-vehicular activities]] with moving equipment and astronauts to particular locations outside [[:en:Skylab|Skylab]].  The [[:en:Canadarm|Canadarm]] serves a similar purpose on the Shuttle, though it is not as dexterous.  This photograph shows the Serpentuator at [[:en:Marshall Space Flight Center|Marshall Space Flight Center]] flat floor facility of building 4711 set to be tested in two dimensions on [[:en:air bearing|air bearing]]s in a manner similar to [[:en:air hockey|air hockey]].  At the near end of the serpentuator is a 5 degrees of freedom (5DF) chair which allows a person strapped in to translate freely in two dimensions as well as roll, pitch, and yaw.  The switch bank to the right of the chair controls the Serpentuator.  Things that look in this picture like jellyfish provide air bearing support along the length of the Serpentuator.
