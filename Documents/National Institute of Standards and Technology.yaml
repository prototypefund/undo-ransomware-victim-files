  {{Information
  |Description=
  This spectrometer ionized the gas at extremely low pressure and measured the mass of the resulting ions. Molecules were identified by their molecular weight and by the molecular weights of their dissociation products. After the gas was introduced, the instrument proceeded automatically to produce a mass spectrum record.
