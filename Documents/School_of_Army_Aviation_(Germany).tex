  \emph{The German School of Army Aviation (Heeresfliegerwaffenschule)
  based at Bückeburg, is one of the schools of the German Army and is
  responsible for the training and development of the German Army
  Aviation Corps' personnel and equipment.}

\end{itemize}

The German School of Army Aviation (Heeresfliegerwaffenschule) based at
Bückeburg, is one of the schools of the German Army and is responsible
for the training and development of the German Army Aviation Corps'
personnel and equipment. Furthermore, the basic training of helicopter
pilots of the other components of the German Armed Forces also takes
place at the School of Army Aviation.

The School of Army Aviation was founded on 1 July 1959 and based first
at Mendig before being transferred on 12 January 1960 to its current
location at Bückeburg Air Base, utilising the facilities of RAF
Bückeburg, constructed by the Royal Air Force in 1946 and closed in the
mid-1950s.

In October 2011 the German Federal Ministry of Defence announced a
reorganisation/reduction of the German Armed Forces. Due to the
reduction of helicopter units within the German Army, some of which are
to be disbanded whereas others are to be transferred to the German Air
Force, and also in light of the already existing international character
of training helicopter pilots, the School of Army Aviation
(Heeresfliegerwaffenschule) will be renamed to International Helicopter
Training Centre. Training of helicopter pilots of the other components
of the German Armed Forces (Air Force and Navy) at Bückeburg started in
2011.
