Silver was mined on the east flank of Mount Irish along Silver Canyon just north of the ghost town of Logan in the 1860s and 1870s. The ghost town of Crystal Springs also populated during this time lies about 7 miles (11 km) to the east at the intersection of US Route 93, Nevada Route 318 and Nevada Route 375. The community of Hiko lies five miles north of Crystal Springs on Route 318. Route 375 crosses the extreme south end of the range at Hancock Summit.
The Mt. Irish Archaeological District consists of four sites on Logan Canyon Road just to the east of the old Logan townsite and just north of the Mount Irish Wilderness Area boundary.
