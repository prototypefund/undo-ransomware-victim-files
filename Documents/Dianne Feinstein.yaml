So even though the photo itself is unlikely to be an ''original work'' of the US Federal Government (since it's not likely they go around taking publicity photos of mayors), that's the closest license I can find in the dropdown box below - it's been released to the public domain by a website run by the Federal Government, and I'm not about to question their right to do so. :-) Probably the best conclusion is that Feinstein herself owns the photo and released it this way via her Senate website.
