Portas turned professional in 1994. He reached his career-high singles ranking of World No. 19 in October 2001.
His only top-level singles title came at the 2001 Hamburg Masters, a tournament in which his mastery of the drop shot (key to his defeat of Juan Carlos Ferrero in the final) earned him the nickname "Drop Shot Dragon". According to the BBC, Lleyton Hewitt said of Portas that "He sure hits a lot of drop shots, but he hits them so well, as well as anyone I have faced.". It is also very remarkable his final at Barcelona Open in 1997. En route to the final he defeated Gustavo Kuerten (eventual champion this same year of French Open), Marcelo Rios, and Carlos Moya but lost in the final to Albert Costa. In 1999, Portas lost the final of San Marino defeated by his countryman Galo Blanco.
He coached WTA player Daniela Hantuchová from November 2008 to February 2009.
