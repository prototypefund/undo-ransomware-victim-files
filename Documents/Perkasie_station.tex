Perkasie is a defunct train station formerly operated by SEPTA Regional
Rail in Perkasie, Pennsylvania, USA. It closed on July 29, 1981 after
SEPTA cancelled its diesel train routes.

The station was formerly operated by the Reading Company and later by
Conrail and SEPTA. East Penn Railroad operates freight trans on the line
for transportation of freight between Lansdale, and beyond. However,
active track ends just north of Quakertown.

The Perkasie Tunnel is located near the station.

Lehigh Valley Transit interurbans used a separate station at Walnut and
Penn, several blocks to the south and east.
