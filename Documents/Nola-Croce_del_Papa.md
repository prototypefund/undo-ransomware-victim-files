The discovery of two bodies which had been caught by the Pyroclastic
flow as they were fleeing a Volcanic eruption from Mount Vesuvius led
archaeologists to find the lost settlement.\
The eruption, which took place in the 2nd millennium BC, covered the
village in volcanic ash. The remains of livestock such as goats were
found, and various fossils were also found as mud had flowed into the
structures and preserved various foodstuffs and plants.

Findings

-   *No human remains have been found in the settlement leading
    archaeologists to believe the populace had escaped, although not all
    had made it to safety.*

-   *Of the entire settlement only three structures remained intact
    after the eruption.*

-   *The lack of personal belongings in the settlement also lead to the
    belief that the people were given enough time to gather their most
    precious belongings before leaving.*

eruption. No human remains have been found in the settlement leading
