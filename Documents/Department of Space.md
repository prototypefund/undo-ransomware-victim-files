History
=======

-   *In 1962, the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) set up Indian
    National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR), with Dr. Vikram

-   *Dr. Kailasavadivoo Sivan is the current chairman, Space Commission,
    Secretary, Department of Space.*

-   *The Government of India constituted the Space Commission and
    established the Department of Space (DoS) in 1972 and brought ISRO
    under DoS management on 1 June 1972.*

In 1961, the Government of India entrusted the responsibility for space
research and for the peaceful use of outer space to the Department of
Atomic Energy (DAE), then under the leadership of Dr. Homi J. Bhabha. In
1962, the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) set up Indian National
Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR), with Dr. Vikram Sarabhai as
chairman, to organise a national space programme.

In 1969, (INCOSPAR) was reconstituted as an advisory body under the
India National Science Academy (INSA) and the Indian Space Research
Organisation was established. The Government of India constituted the
Space Commission and established the Department of Space (DoS) in 1972
and brought ISRO under DoS management on 1 June 1972.
