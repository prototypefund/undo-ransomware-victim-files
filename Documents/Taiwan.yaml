  {{en|1=Hunting Deer: Before this piece was drawn, the natives hunted for subsistence, calling the act "stepping onto the grass".  The act became a custom instead: those above the age of 10 trained with the bow to the point where they shoot with unerring accuracy up to thirty, forty paces.  When the grass grew lush in spring, the tribes harkened to the call for the hunt, bringing all tools and hunting dogs.  They hunted in all directions, piercing the throats of deer for blood and roasting rabbits and fowls on spits.  The innards were gathered and fermented to be a delicacy called "meat shoots"  The skins and furs were traded with the Han Chinese for salt, rice, tobacco, cloths and other items.}}

Description by NASA:  "The island of [[Taiwan]] sits off of the coast of southern China between the East China Sea, the South China Sea, southwestern Japan's Nansei-shoto Islands, and the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The island is mostly mountainous in the east, but gradually transitions to gently sloping plains in the west. At the northern tip of the island is Taiwan's capital city, [[Taipei]], which appears as a large grayish patch surrounded by dark green. In this image, most of Taiwan's eastern coast is dotted with low clouds, with low and high clouds off the coast in the Pacific Ocean. MODIS also detected three fires, which are marked in red. This true-color Terra MODIS was acquired December 15, 2002."}}{{nan|Tâi-uân ê uī-tshenn-tôo. 臺灣的衛星圖。}}
