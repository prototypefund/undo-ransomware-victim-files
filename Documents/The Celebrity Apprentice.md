The Celebrity Apprentice
========================

-   *The Celebrity Apprentice consists of seasons seven to nine and
    eleven to fifteen.*

-   *The Celebrity Apprentice was an American television reality
    competition series.*

-   *The Celebrity Apprentice is linked in seasons to its precursor TV
    show, The Apprentice, which consists of seasons one to six and
    season ten.*

The Celebrity Apprentice was an American television reality competition
series. It is a variation of The Apprentice series, and was hosted by
real estate developer (and now U.S. President) Donald Trump from 2008 to
2015, and actor and former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger
from January 2017. On August 3, 2017, NBC Entertainment Chairman Bob
Greenblatt said that the show has effectively been canceled.

Like its precursor, the show's opening theme song is "For the Love of
Money" by The O'Jays. Unlike its precursor, however, Celebrity
Apprentice consists of celebrities as competing apprentices rather than
unknowns. Some of the celebrities are relatively current while others
tend to be those who have been out of the public eye for some time. All
of them are competing to win money for a charitable organization of
their choice. The celebrities come from a wide variety of different
fields in the media: sitcoms, professional sports, music industry,
reality television, radio, and other backgrounds.

The Celebrity Apprentice is linked in seasons to its precursor TV show,
The Apprentice, which consists of seasons one to six and season ten. The
Celebrity Apprentice consists of seasons seven to nine and eleven to
fifteen.

Format
======

-   *The format of The Celebrity Apprentice follows that of the original
    The Apprentice, outside of living arrangements; there is no communal
    living space, and celebrities are not required to live in the city
    during filming, allowing them to maintain their own appearance
    schedule which may cause them to miss out on tasks at times.*

The format of The Celebrity Apprentice follows that of the original The
Apprentice, outside of living arrangements; there is no communal living
space, and celebrities are not required to live in the city during
filming, allowing them to maintain their own appearance schedule which
may cause them to miss out on tasks at times. The two teams are given
separate suites near the boardroom which they can use for planning and
other activities related to the tasks.

Additionally, the celebrities as contestants are not vying for a job,
but instead each has selected a charity that they are playing for. The
winner of each season gets a large donation made to that charity by the
host, but in addition, winning project managers may also receive
additional charity money by winning a task, either as a fixed amount set
by the host and/or a participating business, or by the total charitable
take they made on the task. The host also has discretion to provide
charity funds to eliminated celebrities as a consolation prize.

History
=======

-   *The rebooted series, The New Celebrity Apprentice first broadcast
    on January 2, 2017.*

-   *In season seven, Donald Trump returned the show to the regular
    Celebrity Apprentice format; TV anchor and talk show host Leeza
    Gibbons won the season.*

-   *Season three of The Celebrity Apprentice aired in the spring of
    2010, and was won by musician Bret Michaels.*

On July 6, 2007, it was announced that The Apprentice had been renewed
for a seventh season, with a possibility of an eighth. In an effort to
revitalize interest in the series, season seven featured celebrities
playing the game to raise money for charities, going under the name The
Celebrity Apprentice as opposed to continuing under The Apprentice
format. British tabloid editor Piers Morgan was declared the winner of
that season. On January 28, 2008, NBC confirmed that season eight would
feature celebrities playing the game to raise money for charity. That
season premiered in March 2009, and resulted in a win for comedian Joan
Rivers.

Season three of The Celebrity Apprentice aired in the spring of 2010,
and was won by musician Bret Michaels.

On March 17, 2010, NBC officially stated that a new season of the
original Apprentice would be brought back, with the explanation that
regular working people would again attract audiences in light of the
damaged U.S. economy. That season premiered September 16, 2010. This
time the ratings were low, and both Trump and Producer Mark Burnett
returned to the 'Celebrity' format, which saw John Rich win in season
four. In season five, late night host Arsenio Hall won. In season six,
the first all-star season took place, bringing back 14 of the most
memorable celebrities to compete for the first title of the All-Star
Celebrity Apprentice, which country singer Trace Adkins won. In season
seven, Donald Trump returned the show to the regular Celebrity
Apprentice format; TV anchor and talk show host Leeza Gibbons won the
season.

After Trump announced his intentions to run for President of the United
States in the 2016 election in 2015, NBC began to re-evaluate their
business relationship with Trump and whether he could still be host of
The Apprentice series. NBC stated that they opted to sever their
business ties with Trump following politically-charged comments that
Trump made in June 2015, and began seeking a new host for the show.
However, Trump stated that it was his decision to end the relationship
with NBC "out of respect", even though he had been approached by Burnett
and NBC to host two more seasons of the show just prior to his
presidential bid. In an April 2016 interview, Trump revealed he earned
about \$213 million from the show over its 14 seasons.

In September 2015, NBC announced that actor and politician Arnold
Schwarzenegger would become the new host of The Celebrity Apprentice to
premiere during the 2016â€“17 television season. The rebooted series, The
New Celebrity Apprentice first broadcast on January 2, 2017. Trump will
remain credited as an Executive Producer to the show, including what is
estimated as a five-figure per-show fee as well as ongoing profits from
the franchise through MGM, the production entity for the show.

On March 3, 2017, NBC announced that Arnold Schwarzenegger stepped down
as host of The Celebrity Apprentice, leaving the show's future up in the
air. Schwarzenegger cited poor ratings as well as his feud with
President Trump as factors in his decision.
