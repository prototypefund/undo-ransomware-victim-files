  MILITARY PERSONNEL: Actions Needed to Address Sexual Assaults of Male Servicemembers
  
  Note: The figure includes both restricted and unrestricted reports of sexual assault. Because of the confidential nature of restricted reports, we are limited in our ability to assess the quality of these data. However, these data are the responsibility of Sexual Assault Response Coordinators, who manage and report on individual cases to their local installation commands, which reduces the likelihood of significant errors in the data. In addition, because for fiscal years 2008 through 2013 DOD's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO) did not collect information on the gender of victims converting reports from restricted to unrestricted, we calculated the minimum number of males and females that could have reported in each of these years and categorized the remainder as unknown.
