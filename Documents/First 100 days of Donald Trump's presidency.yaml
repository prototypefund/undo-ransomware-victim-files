  THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Peter.
  
  MR. NAVARRO:  I remember well during the campaign, the day the President made the [https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/DJT_DeclaringAmericanEconomicIndependence.pdf the speech ('''Declaring American Economic Independence''' on 6/28/2016) outside of Pittsburgh and laid down a set of promises to the American people on trade].  And today, this is the beginning of the fulfillment of those promises in a grand way, with Wilbur Ross at the helm, and the President being the grand strategist of this.  And we're going to get it done for the American people, workers, and domestic manufacturers.  
  
  Thank you.}}
