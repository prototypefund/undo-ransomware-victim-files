  |Description=President [[Richard Nixon]] shakes hands with Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai (name often rendered as "Chou En-lai" in the USA at the time) 
  as First Lady [[Pat Nixon]] looks on. Ji Chaozhu (冀朝铸), Zhou Enlai's translator, stands slightly behind and to his right. It was the first visit by an American president to the nation. During the Geneva Conference in 1954, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles refused to shake Zhou Enlai’s hand. Knowing of this rebuff, President Nixon made a point of shaking Zhou Enlai’s hand upon landing in China.
