  {{Information
  |Description = {{en|1='''MRO investigating Martian water cycle''' - This artist's concept represents the "Follow the Water" theme of NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter mission. The orbiter's science instruments monitor the present water cycle in the Mars atmosphere and the associated deposition and sublimation of water ice on the surface, while probing the subsurface to see how deep the water-ice reservoir detected by Mars Odyssey extends. At the same time, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will search for surface features and minerals (such as carbonates and sulfates) that record the extended presence of liquid water on the surface earlier in the planet's history. The instruments involved are the Shallow Subsurface Radar, the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars, the Mars Color Imager, the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment, the Context Camera and the Mars Climate Sounder.
  
  To the far left, the radar antenna beams down and "sees" into the first few hundred feet (up to 1 kilometer) of Mars' crust. Just to the right of that, the next beam highlights the data received from the imaging spectrometer, which identifies minerals on the surface. The next beam represents the high-resolution camera, which can "zoom in" on local targets, providing the highest-resolution orbital images yet of features such as craters and gullies and rocks.
  
  The beam that shines almost horizontally is that of the Mars Climate Sounder. This instrument is critical to analyzing the current climate of Mars since it observes the temperature, humidity, and dust content of the martian atmosphere, and their seasonal and year-to-year variations. Meanwhile, the Mars Color Imager observes ice clouds, dust clouds and hazes, and the ozone distribution, producing daily global maps in multiple colors to monitor daily weather and seasonal changes.
  
  The electromagnetic spectrum is represented on the top right and individual instruments are placed where their capability lies.}}

  NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter hit a dizzying milestone this morning: It completed 60,000 loops around the Red Planet at 10:39 a.m. PDT (1:39 p.m. EDT). On average, MRO takes 112 minutes to circle Mars, whipping around at about 2 miles per second (3.4 kilometers per second).
  
  Since entering orbit on March 10, 2006, the spacecraft has been collecting daily science about the planet's surface and atmosphere, including detailed views with its High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment camera (HiRISE). HiRISE is powerful enough to see surface features the size of a dining room table from 186 miles (300 kilometers) above the surface.
  
  Meanwhile, MRO is watching the daily weather and probing the subsurface for ice, providing data that can influence the designs of future missions that will take humans to Mars.
  
  But MRO isn't just sending back its own science; it serves in a network of relays that beam data back to Earth from NASA's Mars rovers and landers. Later this month, MRO will hit another milestone: It will have relayed 1 terabit of data, largely from NASA's Curiosity rover. If you've ever enjoyed one of Curiosity's selfies or sprawling landscapes or wondered at its scientific discoveries, MRO probably helped make them possible.
  
  MRO infographic  
  
  "MRO has given scientists and the public a new perspective of Mars," said Project Manager Dan Johnston at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, which leads the mission. "We've also supported NASA's fleet of Mars surface missions, allowing them to send their images and discoveries back to scientists on Earth."
  
  Eyes in the Sky
  
  While rovers and landers can study only their immediate vicinity, orbiters can view wide swaths of the entire planet; MRO can actually target any point on the Martian globe approximately once every two weeks.
  
  MRO's aerial perspective also provides scientists a complementary view of a dynamic planet. As seasons change, they can see avalanches and cloud patterns. HiRISE has imaged CO2 ice sublimating, migrating sand dunes and meteorite strikes reshaping the landscape. With its Mars Climate Sounder instrument and its Mars Color Imager camera, MRO can also study atmospheric events like the massive global dust storm that proved fatal to NASA's Opportunity rover in 2018.
  
  "Mars is our laboratory," said MRO Deputy Project Scientist Leslie Tamppari of JPL. "After more than a decade, we've collected enough data to formulate and test hypotheses to see how they change or hold up over time."
  
  Daily Calls to Earth
  
  MRO is one of several orbiters that send data from Mars to Earth each day. The same way MRO is the primary relay for Curiosity, Odyssey (NASA's longest-lived orbiter) is the primary relay for the agency's latest Martian inhabitant, InSight. The Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) orbiter recently started changing its orbit in preparation to cover the Mars 2020 rover's entry after it lands in February 2021. After data is sent up to an orbiter, it's beamed to giant antennas at one of three locations around Earth, all of which are part of NASA's Deep Space Network.
  
  That relay network is now international. The European Space Agency's Trace Gas Orbiter has been carrying an ever-increasing share of data sent from the surface. And all of these orbiters are preparing for the arrival of ESA's Rosalind Franklin ExoMars rover, which is scheduled to land the same year as Mars 2020.
  
  Mars Landings
  
  Orbiters like MRO and Odyssey are snap-happy, constantly imaging potential landing sites for future missions. But after a site has been selected and a mission is sent to Mars, orbiters play another critical role.
  
  Before a surface mission can begin conducting science, it has to land safely. Successful landings require clocklike precision so that the spacecraft enters the Martian atmosphere at just the right angle, the parachute opens at the right time and sensors detect the rapidly approaching surface.
  
  MRO and other orbiters serve as black boxes, recording data about each landing, which grow more difficult with the sort of added mass that comes with a mission like Mars 2020. Engineers use the data to design safer missions - which will be key to sending astronauts to Mars. With plans to return astronauts to the surface of the Moon by 2024, NASA is looking ahead at humans exploring the Red Planet, too.
  
  NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of Caltech in Pasadena, California, manages the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Project for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. The University of Arizona in Tucson, operates HiRISE, which was built by Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. in Boulder, Colorado. Malin Space Science Systems in San Diego, provided and operates MARCI.}}

  {{Information
  |Description={{en|1=The Mars Color Imager (MARCI) is a two-camera imaging system designed to obtain pictures of the martian surface and atmosphere. The primary scientific objectives of the instrument are to: 1) observe martian atmospheric processes at global scale and synoptically, 2) study details of the interaction of the atmosphere with the surface at a variety of scales in both space and time, and 3) examine surface features characteristic of the evolution of the martian climate over time. These objectives will be accomplished through: 1) monitoring of global, regional, and local meteorological processes and phenomena, 2) study of eolian and polar processes and landforms as indicators of surface/atmospheric interactions, and 3) creation of maps indicating surface composition. MARCI will take approach images of Mars at the end of the cruise phase and globally map the planet from orbit.
  
  MARCI consists of nadir-pointed wide angle and medium angle cameras. Each camera has its own unique optics and identical focal plane assemblies, data acquisition system electronics, and power supplies. MARCI is mounted on the bottom (nadir pointing side) of the Mars Climate Orbiter. Each camera consists of a stray light baffle and lens elements and filters which focus onto an electronically-shuttered CCD. Without the baffle, the wide-angle camera is approximately 4.8 x 4.8 x 3.8 cm and the medium angle camera 5.4 x 5.4 x 5.5 cm. The wide-angle baffle extends an additional 1.4 cm and the medium angle baffle 2 cm. The cameras operate in push-frame fashion, in which a filter plate, consisting of multiple narrowband filter strips in the cross-track direction, is mounted over the detector. Consecutive images are taken each time the camera footprint advances one filter-width (about 20 pixels) in the downtrack direction. The images are 1000 x 1000 pixels in size. The MARCI operating temperature range is -40 to +70 degrees C and survival range is -80 to +100 degrees C.
  
  The wide-angle camera has a field of view of 140 degrees. It has a dual lens system consisting of a five-element fused silica f/6 lens for short UV and a seven-element optical glass f/5 lens for longer UV and visible light. The optical paths of both lens systems are combined by a prism and dichroic beamsplitter, giving an effective focal length of 4.3 mm. It is capable of obtaining images in 7 spectral bands, 5 visible and 2 UV at a resolution of 7.2 km/pixel or better. The raw data rate from the wide-angle camera is 29.6 kbps per band.
  
  The medium-angle camera has a field-of-view of 6 degrees. It has an f/2 catadioptric lens consisting of six elements, five of SiO2 and one of BK7, with an effective focal length of 87.9 mm. Images can be obtained in any of 10 spectral bands, ranging from 425 to 1000 nm, at a nadir resolution of 40 m/pixel. The raw data rate from the medium-angle camera is 704 kbps per band.}}
