  {{Information
  |description={{en|1=The Department of Defense's medical school, the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences teamed up with the Samueli Institute in Alexandria, Va., to offer future military physicians at the college a series of sessions in yoga, acupunture, hypnosis, guided imagery and chiropractic manipulation in Bethesda, Md., on Dec. 7, 2012. Students at the school are primarily active duty uniformed officers in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Public Health Services. The medical college is named after Louisiana Congressman F. Edward Hebert, one of the longest serving members in the U.S. House of Representatives (1941-1977). Hebert was instrumental in the founding of USUHS in 1972. DoD photo by Sandra Lea Abrams}}
