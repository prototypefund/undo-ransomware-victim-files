  {{Information
  |description={{en|1=NASA’s Orion spacecraft will carry astronauts further into space than ever before using a module based on Europe’s Automated Transfer Vehicles (ATV).
  
  The ATV-derived service module, sitting directly below Orion’s crew capsule, will provide propulsion, power, thermal control, as well as supplying water and gas to the astronauts in the habitable module.
  
  The first Orion mission will be an uncrewed lunar flyby in 2017, returning to Earth’s atmosphere at 11 km/s ­– the fastest reentry ever.}}

  {{Information
  |description={{en|1=JSC2007-E-113280 (Dec. 2007) --- Three crewmembers work in the area of their lunar lander on the lunar surface in this NASA artist's rendering. NASA has selected Altair as the name of the lunar lander the Constellation Program will use to put humans on the moon. Project Altair Manager Lauri Hansen made the announcement at a recent industry event at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. Altair will be capable of landing four astronauts on the moon, providing life support and a base for weeklong initial surface exploration missions, and returning the crew to the Orion spacecraft that will bring them home to Earth. Altair will launch aboard an Ares V rocket into low-Earth orbit, where it will rendezvous with the Orion crew vehicle. Please note that this artwork is not precise. NASA currently is seeking input from industry experts and is developing conceptual designs for Altair.}}

  {{Information
  |Description={{en|1=CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. - With more than 12 times the thrust produced by a {{w|Boeing 747}} jet aircraft, the {{w|Constellation program|Constellation Program}}'s {{w|Ares I-X}} test rocket roars off {{w|Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Launch Complex 39B}} at NASA's {{w|Kennedy Space Center}} in Florida. The rocket produces 2.96 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and goes supersonic in 39 seconds. Liftoff of the 6-minute flight test was at 11:30 a.m. EDT Oct. 28. This was the first launch from Kennedy's pads of a vehicle other than the space shuttle since the {{w|Apollo program|Apollo Program}}'s {{w|Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rocket}}s were retired. The parts used to make the Ares I-X booster flew on 30 different shuttle missions ranging from {{w|STS-29}} in 1989 to {{w|STS-106}} in 2000. The data returned from more than 700 sensors throughout the rocket will be used to refine the design of future launch vehicles and bring NASA one step closer to reaching its exploration goals. For information on the Ares I-X vehicle and flight test, visit http://www.nasa.gov/aresIX.}}
