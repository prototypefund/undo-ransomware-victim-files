Tyson was arrested on June 15, 2010 by Raleigh police on charges of second-degree trespassing. He, along with Rev. William Barber, the President of the North Carolina Chapter of the NAACP, and two others protested recent decisions by the Wake County school board by taking over the seats of several school board members. They were opposing the school board's decision to change its diversity policy, based on busing students to try to balance socio-economic diversity. In consideration of parents' concerns, the school board recently decided to change to a community school system, where students can attend schools close to where they live. Tyson believes this will lead to de facto segregation because of residential patterns.
