The Apollo 11 goodwill messages are statements from leaders of 73
countries around the world on a disc about the size of a 50-cent piece
made of silicon that was left on the Moon by the Apollo 11 astronauts.

The disc also carried names of the leadership of the Congress, the four
committees of the House and Senate responsible for legislation related
to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and NASA's
top management, including past administrators and deputy administrators.

At the top of the disc is the inscription: "Goodwill messages from
around the world brought to the Moon by the astronauts of Apollo 11."
Around the rim is the statement: "From Planet Earth -\/- July 1969". The
disc was manufactured by Sprague Electric Company of North Adams,
Massachusetts. NASA head Thomas O. Paine proposed the idea to the U.S.
State Department, and corresponded with world leaders to solicit their
messages. These were enshrined by being photographed and reduced to
1/200 scale ultra microfiche silicon etching. The disc rests in an
aluminum case on the Moon's Sea of Tranquility.
