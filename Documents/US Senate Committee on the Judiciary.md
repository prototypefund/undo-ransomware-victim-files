The United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, informally the
Senate Judiciary Committee, is a standing committee of 22 U.S. Senators
whose role is to oversee the Department of Justice (DOJ), consider
executive nominations, and review pending legislation.

The Judiciary Committee's oversight of the DOJ includes all of the
agencies under the DOJ's jurisdiction, such as the FBI. It also has
oversight of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Committee
considers presidential nominations for positions in the DOJ, the Office
of National Drug Control Policy, the State Justice Institute, and
certain positions in the Department of Commerce and DHS. It is also in
charge of holding hearings and investigating judicial nominations to the
Supreme Court, the U.S. court of appeals, the U.S. district courts, and
the Court of International Trade. The Standing Rules of the Senate
confer jurisdiction to the Senate Judiciary Committee in certain areas,
such as considering proposed constitutional amendments and legislation
related to federal criminal law, human rights law, immigration,
intellectual property, antitrust law, and internet privacy.
