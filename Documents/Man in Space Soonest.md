Man In Space Soonest (MISS) was a United States Air Force (USAF) program
to put a man into outer space before the Soviet Union. The program was
cancelled on August 1, 1958, and was replaced by NASA's Project Mercury.
Only two men from the program would actually reach outer space. The
first, Joseph A. Walker, did so twice in two X-15 rocket plane tests in
1963. Another, Neil Armstrong, became a NASA astronaut in 1962 and
became the first person to walk on the Moon in 1969.

Astronaut candidates
====================

-   *The first member of the group to achieve international astronaut
    recognition, and to enter space twice, on two X-15 test flights.*

-   *Flew on Gemini 8 and Apollo 11 missions; performed the first
    docking of two spacecraft, was the first - along with Buzz Aldrin -
    to land on the Moon, and was the first person to set foot on the
    Moon.*

MISS would have used a Thor booster, then later an Atlas, to launch a
single-man spacecraft into orbit. On June 25, 1958, the Air Force
announced the following nine men selected to be astronauts for the
program:

Neil A. Armstrong (1930–2012), 27, NACA. The only member of the group to
join the NASA Astronaut Corps. Flew on Gemini 8 and Apollo 11 missions;
performed the first docking of two spacecraft, was the first - along
with Buzz Aldrin - to land on the Moon, and was the first person to set
foot on the Moon.

Joseph A. Walker (1921–1966), 37, NACA. The first member of the group to
