Alexander McKay (geologist)
===========================

-   *McKay's greatest achievement was to free New Zealand sciences from
    the strictures of European-based thinking, developing new theories,
    of worldwide importance, on block faulting in the evolution of
    mountain systems.*

-   *In 1872 James Hector appointed him to the Geological Survey of New
    Zealand.*

-   *Alexander McKay (11 April 1841 – 8 July 1917) was a New Zealand
    geologist.*

Alexander McKay (11 April 1841 – 8 July 1917) was a New Zealand
geologist. He was born in Carsphairn, Kirkcudbrightshire, Scotland on 11
April 1841.

McKay reached New Zealend in 1863 where he spent a number of years
prospected for gold. A meeting with Julius von Haast saw a change of
direction in which McKay, largely self-taught, undertook geological
mapping and fossil collecting expeditions throughout the islands. In
1872 James Hector appointed him to the Geological Survey of New Zealand.

McKay's greatest achievement was to free New Zealand sciences from the
strictures of European-based thinking, developing new theories, of
worldwide importance, on block faulting in the evolution of mountain
systems. The discipline of neotectonics is largely based upon McKay's
observations and theories.
