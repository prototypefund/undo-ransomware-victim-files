History
=======

-   *In 2004, the loop was removed and a new, larger station was built
    to better accommodate the light rail cars.*

-   *The Pittsburgh Railways interurban line from Charleroi to
    Pittsburgh was opened through South Park on September 12, 1903, with
    passengers changing at Castle Shannon to continue their journey to
    Downtown via the Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Railroad.*

-   *In the late 1980s, new light rail vehicles began to use the line.*

The Pittsburgh Railways interurban line from Charleroi to Pittsburgh was
opened through South Park on September 12, 1903, with passengers
changing at Castle Shannon to continue their journey to Downtown via the
Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Railroad. It was cut back to Library in
1953, with a turnaround loop for the single-ended PCC's that operated on
the line. In the late 1980s, new light rail vehicles began to use the
line. These new cars had larger, articulated bodies, and were thus
unable to negotiate the loop. Moreover, these cars were double-ended,
eliminating the need for such turn-around facilities. In 2004, the loop
was removed and a new, larger station was built to better accommodate
the light rail cars.
