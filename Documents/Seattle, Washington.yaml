  {{Information
  |Description={{en|Description in the published source (1919):
  <blockquote>First street car at Occidental Avenue and Yesler Way, about 1884. The view is across Pioneer Square. The building in the background stood on the present site of the Mutual Life Building at First Avenue and Yesler Way. The building on the right is a hotel. It was destroyed in the Great Fire and the Seattle Hotel Building now occupies this site. Mayor Leary and a party of invited guests are in the car.</blockquote>
  <br />
  The hotel in question was the Occidental Hotel. The Seattle Hotel on the same site was demolished in the 1960s. The Mutual Life Bilding, alluded to, is still at the corner of First and Yesler.
  <br />
  The tram is horse-drawn. Visible signs on the streetcar say "Second & Front St's", "Seattle Street Railway". In 1884, First Avenue would have been called Front Street and Occidental Avenue would have been called Second Street. The names were changed after the Great Seattle Fire (1889). Mayor Leary was John Leary, a business leader. 
  <br />
  In the background at center is the Yesler-Leary Building.
