  |Description={{en|United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power interviews Caitlyn Jenner about LGBT rights for Human Rights Day, 10 December 2015
  
  Here's what Ambassador Power said about it on Facebook:
  :Today is International Human Rights Day. At the United Nations, we’re working to integrate LGBT rights into every discussion on human rights, but there is still so much more we can do so that everyone has the freedom to live as they are without fear. It was good to talk to Caitlyn Jenner recently about the important work we can do at home, at the UN, and internationally. Around the world - and here in the US - transgender people face bullying, abuse, and even fatal violence simply for who they are. The threat is all too real for too many: from 2008-2014, over 1,600 transgender people were killed worldwide. [https://www.facebook.com/AmbassadorPower/videos/1737234223177678 LINK].}}
