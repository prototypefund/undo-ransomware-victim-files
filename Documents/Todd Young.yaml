  {{Information
  |description={{en|1=WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) today issued the following statement after meeting with Judge Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump’s nominee to serve as Supreme Court justice:  
  
  “Today, I had the opportunity to sit down with Judge Kavanaugh and discuss a wide range of issues that are important to Hoosiers, including his approach to interpreting the Constitution. Judge Kavanaugh is a good and decent person, a family man, and a well-respected jurist. If confirmed, I have confidence that he will be faithful to the Constitution and preserve the integrity of the Supreme Court. Our discussion today will be very helpful as I continue to review Judge Kavanaugh’s record.”}}
