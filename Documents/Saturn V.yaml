When the S-II (second) stage of the powerful Saturn V rocket burnt out and was separated the remaining units approached orbit around the Earth. Injection into the desired orbit was attained as the S-IVB (third stage) was ignited and burnt. The S-IVB stage was powered by a single 200,000-pound thrust J-2 engine and had a re-start capability built in for its J-2 engine. The S-IVB restarted to speed the Apollo spacecraft to escape velocity injecting it and the astronauts into a moon trajectory. "}}

The instrument unit (IU) was hoisted to be mated to the S-IC/S-II assembly in the Vehicle Assembly Building high bay at the Kennedy Space Center.<br>
  ''Note that the access door has been removed (about 8 o'clock), to allow technicians to enter the IU after it is stacked. The access door is location 8. Location 7 is to the right, with the nitrogen purge ducts (used during refueling to prevent the buildup of dangerous fumes). Location 6 has the silver cylinder that is the water accumulator. (This water sublimated to space during a mission, providing cooling for the elctronics in the IU.) To the right, at locations 5 and 4 are shelves to hold batteries. This differs from the configuration for IU-514, on display at the NASM. IU-514 has the water accumulator at location 3, to the right of the battery shelves. At the right (4 o'clock), at location 22, is the silver sphere holding the nitrogen supply for the gyro gas bearings. IU-514 also differs in having another battery shelf at location 24, two places to the left of the nitrogen sphere. Note the −X marking on the side facing us (12 o'clock), indicating that the old coordinate system was in use for this mission.''}}

  {{Information
  |Description = Apollo 11 flies towards earth orbit with the American flag in the foreground. The Apollo 11 Saturn V rocket launched with astronauts Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin, at 9:32 a.m. EDT July 16, 1969, from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39A. During the eight-day mission, Armstrong and Aldrin descended in a lunar module to the moon's surface while Collins orbited overhead in the command module. The two astronauts spent 22 hours on the moon, including two and one-half hours outside the lunar module. They gathered samples of lunar material and deployed scientific experiments which transmitted data about the lunar environment. They rejoined Collins in the command module for the return trip to earth.

  Still from film footage showing interstage between the S-IC first stage and S-II second stage falling away during the Apollo 6 flight.
  
  The image is taken from the perspective of the second stage and was recorded by a film cameras that were jettisoned soon after the first stage separation and though about 200,000 feet in altitude, were still below orbital velocity. They then reentered the atmosphere and parachuted to the ocean where they floated waiting for recovery. They were filmed at high speeds causing the slow motion look of the sequence when seen in a documentary.

  {{Information
  |Description={{en|1=CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. - With more than 23 times the power output of the Hoover Dam, the Constellation Program's Ares I-X test rocket zooms off Launch Complex 39B at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The rocket produces 2.96 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and reaches a speed of 100 mph in eight seconds. Liftoff of the 6-minute flight test was at 11:30 a.m. EDT Oct. 28. This was the first launch from Kennedy's pads of a vehicle other than the space shuttle since the Apollo Program's Saturn rockets were retired. The parts used to make the Ares I-X booster flew on 30 different shuttle missions ranging from STS-29 in 1989 to STS-106 in 2000. The data returned from more than 700 sensors throughout the rocket will be used to refine the design of future launch vehicles and bring NASA one step closer to reaching its exploration goals.
