  {{Information
   |Description    = Judge Robert A. Katzmann (2nd Cir.), Judge Damon J. Keith (6th Cir.), and Judge Sonia Sotomayor (2nd Cir.), were among those viewing the Marching Toward Justice display when it was at the Second Circuit. The exhibit, which is a pictorial history of the 14th Amendment, was commissioned by the Damon J.Keith Law Collection of African-American Legal History at Wayne State University in Detroit. Through photographs, drawings and reproductions of documents, the exhibit examines the topics of slavery, black soldiers in the Civil War, the Emancipation Proclamation, and ratification of the 14th Amendment in 1868. It also highlights the role of Thurgood Marshall and other African-American lawyers in the Supreme Court decision, Brown v. the Board of Education, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this year. <br/>
