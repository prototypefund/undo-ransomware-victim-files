Enrico Verson
=============

-   *Enrico Verson (25 April 1845 in Padua – 15 February 1927 in Padua)
    was an Italian entomologist,*

-   *Verson made many observations on the biology of the silkworm and
    made anatomical discoveries such as the cells of Verson (apical
    cells of the genital apparatus of certain insects) and glands of
    Verson (glands of the exoskeleton (skin) of the caterpillars playing
    an important part in the moult).*

Enrico Verson (25 April 1845 in Padua – 15 February 1927 in Padua) was
an Italian entomologist,

A physician, Verson worked initially at the experimental station of
Gorigia before founding the first research station on the silkworm in
the world, the Stazione Bacologica Sperimentale in 1871. Verson made
many observations on the biology of the silkworm and made anatomical
discoveries such as the cells of Verson (apical cells of the genital
apparatus of certain insects) and glands of Verson (glands of the
exoskeleton (skin) of the caterpillars playing an important part in the
moult).

He had a considerable influence on the Italian entomologists of his and
the following generation like Antonio Berlese (1863–1927), Adolfo
Targioni Tozzetti (1823–1902) and Filippo Silvestri (1873–1949).
