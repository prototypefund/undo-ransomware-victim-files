Critical reception

Reviewing in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: "Would you believe second-generation Emitt Rhodes? Well, this is an exemplary singles album—gimmicky, banal, full of filler, and filled out with a few more catchy little numbers to go with "Speak to the Sky". Recommended follow-ups: 'Hooky Jo' to keep on rock-rock-rocking, 'If I Didn't Mean to Love You' for a future in Vegas balladeering."
