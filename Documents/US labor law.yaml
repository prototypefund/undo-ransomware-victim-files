  |description={{en|1=United States President {{w|Barack Obama}} bends down to allow the son of a White House staff member to touch his head during a family visit to the Oval Office on 8 May 2009. The boy wanted to see if the President's haircut felt like his own.
  
  [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/24/us/politics/indelible-image-of-a-boys-pat-on-obamas-head-hangs-in-white-house.html From The New York Times, 23 May 2012]:
  <blockquote>''The boy in the picture is Jacob Philadelphia of Columbia, Md. Three years ago this month'' [in May 2009], ''his father, Carlton, a former Marine, was leaving the White House staff after a two-year stint on the National Security Council that began in the Bush administration. As departing staff members often do, Mr. Philadelphia asked for a family photograph with Mr. Obama.''
  <br /><br />
  ''When the pictures were taken and the family was about to leave, Mr. Philadelphia told Mr. Obama that his sons each had a question. In interviews, he and his wife, Roseane, said they did not know what the boys would ask. The White House photographer, Pete Souza, was surprised, too, as the photo's awkward composition attests: The parents' heads are cut off; Jacob's arm obscures his face; and his older brother, Isaac, is blurry.''
  <br /><br />
  ''Jacob spoke first.''
  <br /><br />
  ''"I want to know if my hair is just like yours," he told Mr. Obama, so quietly that the president asked him to speak again.''
  <br /><br />
  ''Jacob did, and Mr. Obama replied, "Why don't you touch it and see for yourself?" He lowered his head, level with Jacob, who hesitated.''
  <br /><br />
  ''"Touch it, dude!" Mr. Obama said.''
  <br /><br />
  ''As Jacob patted the presidential crown, Mr. Souza snapped.''
  <br /><br />
  ''"So, what do you think?" Mr. Obama asked.''
  <br /><br />
  ''"Yes, it does feel the same," Jacob said.''</blockquote>
