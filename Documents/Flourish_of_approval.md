A flourish of approval or krul is a mostly Dutch symbol used for grading
schoolwork or to show that one has seen and agreed with a paragraph. The
krul first appeared in the early 19th century together with the rising
bureaucracy in the Netherlands. Historians believe that the symbol is
derived from a hastily written 'g' which would stand for good (goed) or
seen (gezien). The symbol is rarely used outside of the Netherlands
apart from (former) Dutch colonies like Indonesia, South Africa, the
Netherlands Antilles and Suriname.

Despite its wide usage throughout the country and its former colonies
there is no unicode symbol for it.
