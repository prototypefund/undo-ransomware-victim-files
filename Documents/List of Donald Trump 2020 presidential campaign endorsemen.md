Endorsements
============

The Republican Party
====================

-   *In December of 2018, the Trump campaign announced that it was
    merging its field operations with that of the Republican National
    Committee's.*

Starting in 1932, when President Hoover was able to unanimously secure
that year's nomination despite losing most primaries, the Republican
party has always unofficially supported the incumbent despite remaining
officially aloof.\[original research?\] This strategy has not always
proven successful, as President Gerald Ford nearly lost the nomination
in the 1976 primaries and President George H.W. Bush was badly damaged
there in 1992.\[citation needed\]

In December of 2018, the Trump campaign announced that it was merging
its field operations with that of the Republican National Committee's.
The following month at the RNC's winter meeting in New Mexico, while
acknowledging that declaring the President the party's provisional
nominee would break FEC rules, the RNC voted to endorse him informally
by voting to give him its "full support."
