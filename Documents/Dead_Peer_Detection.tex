Dead Peer Detection (DPD) is a method of detecting a dead Internet Key
Exchange (IKE) peer. The method uses IPsec traffic patterns to minimize
the number of messages required to confirm the availability of a peer.
DPD is used to reclaim the lost resources in case a peer is found dead
and it is also used to perform IKE peer failover.
