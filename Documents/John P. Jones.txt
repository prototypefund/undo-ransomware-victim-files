In 1903 Jones retired to his 1889 home, Miramar, in Santa Monica where he continued to oversee his businesses.  Shortly before the Senator died, Miramar was sold to King Gillette.  Gillette rarely visited the house, and after a brief spell towards the end of World War I as a boys military academy, the estate was sold to hotelier Gilbert Stevenson and it became the Hotel Miramar in 1921.  Since then, it has been run by various hoteliers — except for during World War II, when the Army Air Corps took over the Miramar and used it as a redistribution center for officers and enlisted men returning from overseas.  The mansion was demolished in 1938, leaving as the oldest structure, the six story "Palisades"  wing built in 1924. The Moreton Bay Fig Tree, given to the Jones’ by the bartender in 1889, still stands where it was planted by gardener W.H. Lee.  The site is now the home of the Fairmont Miramar Hotel.
