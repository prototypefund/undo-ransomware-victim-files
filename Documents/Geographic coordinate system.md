the Equator.*

Geographic coordinate system
============================

-   *A common choice of coordinates is latitude, longitude and
    elevation.*

-   *A geographic coordinate system is a coordinate system that enables
    every location on Earth to be specified by a set of numbers, letters
    or symbols.*

A geographic coordinate system is a coordinate system that enables every
location on Earth to be specified by a set of numbers, letters or
symbols. The coordinates are often chosen such that one of the numbers
represents a vertical position and two or three of the numbers represent
a horizontal position; alternatively, a geographic position may be
expressed in a combined three-dimensional Cartesian vector.\
A common choice of coordinates is latitude, longitude and elevation.\
To specify a location on a plane requires a map projection.

History
=======

-   *The invention of a geographic coordinate system is generally
    credited to Eratosthenes of Cyrene, who composed his now-lost
    Geography at the Library of Alexandria in the 3rd century BC.*

-   *Ptolemy credited him with the full adoption of longitude and
    latitude, rather than measuring latitude in terms of the length of
    the midsummer day.*

-   *Ptolemy's 2nd-century Geography used the same prime meridian but
    measured latitude from the Equator instead.*

The invention of a geographic coordinate system is generally credited to
Eratosthenes of Cyrene, who composed his now-lost Geography at the
Library of Alexandria in the 3rd century BC. A century later, Hipparchus
of Nicaea improved on this system by determining latitude from stellar
measurements rather than solar altitude and determining longitude by
timings of lunar eclipses, rather than dead reckoning. In the 1st or 2nd
century, Marinus of Tyre compiled an extensive gazetteer and
mathematically-plotted world map using coordinates measured east from a
prime meridian at the westernmost known land, designated the Fortunate
Isles, off the coast of western Africa around the Canary or Cape Verde
Islands, and measured north or south of the island of Rhodes off Asia
Minor. Ptolemy credited him with the full adoption of longitude and
latitude, rather than measuring latitude in terms of the length of the
midsummer day.

Ptolemy's 2nd-century Geography used the same prime meridian but
measured latitude from the Equator instead. After their work was
translated into Arabic in the 9th century, Al-Khwārizmī's Book of the
Description of the Earth corrected Marinus' and Ptolemy's errors
regarding the length of the Mediterranean Sea, causing medieval Arabic
cartography to use a prime meridian around 10° east of Ptolemy's line.
Mathematical cartography resumed in Europe following Maximus Planudes'
recovery of Ptolemy's text a little before 1300; the text was translated
into Latin at Florence by Jacobus Angelus around 1407.

In 1884, the United States hosted the International Meridian Conference,
attended by representatives from twenty-five nations. Twenty-two of them
agreed to adopt the longitude of the Royal Observatory in Greenwich,
England as the zero-reference line. The Dominican Republic voted against
the motion, while France and Brazil abstained. France adopted Greenwich
Mean Time in place of local determinations by the Paris Observatory in
1911.

Geodetic datum
==============

-   *They then choose the most appropriate mapping of the spherical
    coordinate system onto that ellipsoid, called a terrestrial
    reference system or geodetic datum.*

-   *Given a location, the datum provides the latitude\
    \
    \
    \
    ϕ\
    \
    \
    {\\displaystyle \\phi }\
    \
    \
    and longitude\
    \
    \
    \
    λ\
    \
    \
    {\\displaystyle \\lambda }\
    \
    \
    .*

In order to be unambiguous about the direction of "vertical" and the
"horizontal" surface above which they are measuring, map-makers choose a
reference ellipsoid with a given origin and orientation that best fits
their need for the area they are mapping. They then choose the most
appropriate mapping of the spherical coordinate system onto that
ellipsoid, called a terrestrial reference system or geodetic datum.

Datums may be global, meaning that they represent the whole Earth, or
they may be local, meaning that they represent an ellipsoid best-fit to
only a portion of the Earth. Points on the Earth's surface move relative
to each other due to continental plate motion, subsidence, and diurnal
Earth tidal movement caused by the Moon and the Sun. This daily movement
can be as much as a meter. Continental movement can be up to 10 cm a
year, or 10 m in a century. A weather system high-pressure area can
cause a sinking of 5 mm. Scandinavia is rising by 1 cm a year as a
result of the melting of the ice sheets of the last ice age, but
neighbouring Scotland is rising by only 0.2 cm. These changes are
insignificant if a local datum is used, but are statistically
significant if a global datum is used.

Examples of global datums include World Geodetic System (WGS 84), the
default datum used for the Global Positioning System, The distance to
Earth's center can be used both for very deep positions and for
positions in space.

Local datums chosen by a national cartographical organisation include
the North American Datum, the European ED50, and the British OSGB36.
Given a location, the datum provides the latitude\
\
\
\
ϕ\
\
\
{\\displaystyle \\phi }\
\
\
and longitude\
\
\
\
λ\
\
\
{\\displaystyle \\lambda }\
\
\
. In the United Kingdom there are three common latitude, longitude, and
height systems in use. WGS 84 differs at Greenwich from the one used on
published maps OSGB36 by approximately 112 m. The military system ED50,
used by NATO, differs from about 120 m to 180 m.

The latitude and longitude on a map made against a local datum may not
be the same as one obtained from a GPS receiver. Coordinates from the
mapping system can sometimes be roughly changed into another datum using
a simple translation. For example, to convert from ETRF89 (GPS) to the
Irish Grid add 49 meters to the east, and subtract 23.4 meters s from
the north. More generally one datum is changed into any other datum
using a process called Helmert transformations. This involves converting
the spherical coordinates into Cartesian coordinates and applying a
seven parameter transformation (translation, three-dimensional
rotation), and converting back.

In popular GIS software, data projected in latitude/longitude is often
represented as a Geographic Coordinate System. For example, data in
latitude/longitude if the datum is the North American Datum of 1983 is
denoted by 'GCS North American 1983'.

Horizontal coordinates
======================

Latitude and longitude
======================

-   *The "latitude" (abbreviation: Lat., φ, or phi) of a point on
    Earth's surface is the angle between the equatorial plane and the
    straight line that passes through that point and through (or close
    to) the center of the Earth.*

-   *The "longitude" (abbreviation: Long., λ, or lambda) of a point on
    Earth's surface is the angle east or west of a reference meridian to
    another meridian that passes through that point.*

The "latitude" (abbreviation: Lat., φ, or phi) of a point on Earth's
surface is the angle between the equatorial plane and the straight line
that passes through that point and through (or close to) the center of
the Earth. Lines joining points of the same latitude trace circles on
the surface of Earth called parallels, as they are parallel to the
Equator and to each other. The North Pole is 90° N; the South Pole is
90° S. The 0° parallel of latitude is designated the Equator, the
fundamental plane of all geographic coordinate systems. The Equator
divides the globe into Northern and Southern Hemispheres.

The "longitude" (abbreviation: Long., λ, or lambda) of a point on
Earth's surface is the angle east or west of a reference meridian to
another meridian that passes through that point. All meridians are
halves of great ellipses (often called great circles), which converge at
the North and South Poles. The meridian of the British Royal Observatory
in Greenwich, in south-east London, England, is the international prime
meridian, although some organizations—such as the French Institut
Géographique National—continue to use other meridians for internal
purposes. The prime meridian determines the proper Eastern and Western
Hemispheres, although maps often divide these hemispheres further west
in order to keep the Old World on a single side. The antipodal meridian
of Greenwich is both 180°W and 180°E. This is not to be conflated with
the International Date Line, which diverges from it in several places
for political reasons, including between far eastern Russia and the far
western Aleutian Islands.

The combination of these two components specifies the position of any
location on the surface of Earth, without consideration of altitude or
depth. The grid formed by lines of latitude and longitude is known as a
"graticule". The origin/zero point of this system is located in the Gulf
of Guinea about 625 km (390 mi) south of Tema, Ghana.

Length of a degree
==================

-   *On the WGS84 spheroid, the length in meters of a degree of latitude
    at latitude φ (that is, the distance along a north–south line from
    latitude (φ − 0.5) degrees to (φ + 0.5) degrees) is about*

-   *Similarly, the length in meters of a degree of longitude can be
    calculated as*

-   *is 6,367,449 m. Since the Earth is not spherical that result can be
    off by several tenths of a percent; a better approximation of a
    longitudinal degree at latitude\

On the GRS80 or WGS84 spheroid at sea level at the Equator, one
latitudinal second measures 30.715 meters, one latitudinal minute is
1843  meters and one latitudinal degree is 110.6 kilometres. The circles
of longitude, meridians, meet at the geographical poles, with the
west-east width of a second naturally decreasing as latitude increases.
On the Equator at sea level, one longitudinal second measures
30.92 meters, a longitudinal minute is 1855 meters and a longitudinal
degree is 111.3 kilometres. At 30° a longitudinal second is
26.76 meters, at Greenwich (51°28′38″N) 19.22 meters, and at 60° it is
15.42 meters.

On the WGS84 spheroid, the length in meters of a degree of latitude at
latitude φ (that is, the distance along a north–south line from latitude
(φ − 0.5) degrees to (φ + 0.5) degrees) is about

this is the exact distance along a parallel of latitude; getting the
distance along the shortest route will be more work, but those two
distances are always within 0.6 meter of each other if the two points
are one degree of longitude apart.

Map projection
==============

-   *To establish the position of a geographic location on a map, a map
    projection is used to convert geodetic coordinates to plane
    coordinates on a map; it projects the datum ellipsoidal coordinates
    and height onto a flat surface of a map.*

-   *The datum, along with a map projection applied to a grid of
    reference locations, establishes a grid system for plotting
    locations.*

To establish the position of a geographic location on a map, a map
projection is used to convert geodetic coordinates to plane coordinates
on a map; it projects the datum ellipsoidal coordinates and height onto
a flat surface of a map. The datum, along with a map projection applied
to a grid of reference locations, establishes a grid system for plotting
locations. Common map projections in current use include the Universal
Transverse Mercator (UTM), the Military Grid Reference System (MGRS),
the United States National Grid (USNG), the Global Area Reference System
(GARS) and the World Geographic Reference System (GEOREF).\
Coordinates on a map are usually in terms northing N and easting E
offsets relative to a specified origin.

Map projection formulas depend in the geometry of the projection as well
as parameters dependent on the particular location at which the map is
projected. The set of parameters can vary based on type of project and
the conventions chosen for the projection. For the transverse Mercator
projection used in UTM, the parameters associated are the latitude and
longitude of the natural origin, the false northing and false easting,
and an overall scale factor. Given the parameters associated with
particular location or grin, the projection formulas for the transverse
Mercator are a complex mix of algebraic and trigonometric
functions.:45-54

UTM and UPS systems
===================

-   *The UTM system is not a single map projection but a series of
    sixty, each covering 6-degree bands of longitude.*

-   *The UPS system is used for the polar regions, which are not covered
    by the UTM system.*

The Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) and Universal Polar
Stereographic (UPS) coordinate systems both use a metric-based Cartesian
grid laid out on a conformally projected surface to locate positions on
the surface of the Earth. The UTM system is not a single map projection
but a series of sixty, each covering 6-degree bands of longitude. The
UPS system is used for the polar regions, which are not covered by the
UTM system.

Stereographic coordinate system
===============================

-   *\[citation needed\] The stereographic coordinate system was
    superseded by the latitude-longitude system.*

-   *Although no longer used in navigation, the stereographic coordinate
    system is still used in modern times to describe crystallographic
    orientations in the fields of crystallography, mineralogy and
    materials science.*

-   *During medieval times, the stereographic coordinate system was used
    for navigation purposes.*

Vertical coordinates
====================

-   *Vertical coordinates include height and depth.*

Vertical coordinates include height and depth.

3D Cartesian coordinates
========================

-   *Cartesian coordinates simplify many mathematical calculations.*

-   *Every point that is expressed in ellipsoidal coordinates can be
    expressed as an rectilinear x y z (Cartesian) coordinate.*

Every point that is expressed in ellipsoidal coordinates can be
expressed as an rectilinear x y z (Cartesian) coordinate. Cartesian
coordinates simplify many mathematical calculations. The Cartesian
systems of different datums are not equivalent.

Earth-centered, Earth-fixed
===========================

-   *The conventional right-handed coordinate system puts:*

-   *The Earth-centered Earth-fixed (also known as the ECEF, ECF, or
    conventional terrestrial coordinate system) rotates with the Earth
    and has its origin at the center of the Earth.*

-   *See "Geodetic system."*

-   *The origin at the center of mass of the Earth, a point close to the
    Earth's center of figure*

The Earth-centered Earth-fixed (also known as the ECEF, ECF, or
conventional terrestrial coordinate system) rotates with the Earth and
has its origin at the center of the Earth.

The conventional right-handed coordinate system puts:

The origin at the center of mass of the Earth, a point close to the
Earth's center of figure

The Z axis on the line between the North and South Poles, with positive
values increasing northward (but does not exactly coincide with the
Earth's rotational axis)

The X and Y axes in the plane of the Equator

The X axis passing through extending from 180 degrees longitude at the
Equator (negative) to 0 degrees longitude (prime meridian) at the
Equator (positive)

The Y axis passing through extending from 90 degrees west longitude at
the Equator (negative) to 90 degrees east longitude at the Equator
(positive)

An example is the NGS data for a brass disk near Donner Summit, in
California. Given the dimensions of the ellipsoid, the conversion from
lat/lon/height-above-ellipsoid coordinates to X-Y-Z is
straightforward—calculate the X-Y-Z for the given lat-lon on the surface
of the ellipsoid and add the X-Y-Z vector that is perpendicular to the
ellipsoid there and has length equal to the point's height above the
ellipsoid. The reverse conversion is harder: given X-Y-Z we can
immediately get longitude, but no closed formula for latitude and height
exists. See "Geodetic system." Using Bowring's formula in 1976 Survey
Review the first iteration gives latitude correct within 10-11 degree as
long as the point is within 10000 meters above or 5000 meters below the
ellipsoid.

Local tangent plane
===================

-   *The vertical coordinate can point either up or down.*

-   *The local ENU coordinates are formed from a plane tangent to the
    Earth's surface fixed to a specific location and hence it is
    sometimes known as a local tangent or local geodetic plane.*

-   *In many targeting and tracking applications the local ENU Cartesian
    coordinate system is far more intuitive and practical than ECEF or
    geodetic coordinates.*

A local tangent plane can be defined based on the vertical and
horizontal dimensions. The vertical coordinate can point either up or
down. There are two kinds of conventions for the frames:

East, North, up (ENU), used in geography

North, East, down (NED), used specially in aerospace

In many targeting and tracking applications the local ENU Cartesian
coordinate system is far more intuitive and practical than ECEF or
geodetic coordinates. The local ENU coordinates are formed from a plane
tangent to the Earth's surface fixed to a specific location and hence it
is sometimes known as a local tangent or local geodetic plane. By
convention the east axis is labeled\
\
\
\
x\
\
\
{\\displaystyle x}\
\
\
, the north\
\
\
\
y\
\
\
{\\displaystyle y}\
\
\
and the up\
\
\
\
z\
\
\
{\\displaystyle z}\
\
\
.

In an airplane, most objects of interest are below the aircraft, so it
is sensible to define down as a positive number. The NED coordinates
allow this as an alternative to the ENU. By convention, the north axis
is labeled\
\
\
\
\
x\
′\
\
\
\
{\\displaystyle x'}\
\
\
, the east\
\
\
\
\
y\
′\
\
\
\
{\\displaystyle y'}\
\
\
and the down\
\
\
\
\
z\
′\
\
\
\
{\\displaystyle z'}\
\
\
. To avoid confusion between\
\
\
\
x\
\
\
{\\displaystyle x}\
\
\
and\
\
\
\
\
x\
′\
\
\
\
{\\displaystyle x'}\
\
\
, etc. in this article we will restrict the local coordinate frame to
ENU.
