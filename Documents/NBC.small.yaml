  * It was created for publicity purposes-distribution to the media. The image was meant to bring attention and publicity for the network, the same as the publicity photos for actors and actresses in the film industry were intended to do. 
  Film production expert Eve Light Honthaner in ''The Complete Film Production Handbook'', (Focal Press, 2001 p. 211.):
  :"Publicity photos (star headshots) have traditionally not been copyrighted. Since they are disseminated to the public, they are generally considered public domain, and therefore clearance by the studio that produced them is not necessary."  
  ::"There is a vast body of photographs, including but not limited to publicity stills, that have no notice as to who may have created them."  (''The Professional Photographer's Legal Handbook'' By Nancy E. Wolff, Allworth Communications, 2007, p. 55.)
  :[http://www.creativeclearance.com/guidelines.html#B1 Creative Clearance-Publicity photos]
  ::"Publicity Photos (star headshots) older publicity stills have usually not been copyrighted and since they have been disseminated to the public, they are generally considered public domain and therefore there is no necessity to clear them with the studio that produced them (if you can even determine who did)."

  {{Information
  |Description=Photo of Grace Brandt and Eddie Albert in an early NBC television program ''The Honeymooners-Grace and Eddie Show''.  The program ran on radio from [[w:en:Eddie_Albert#Career|1933]] to 1936.  Movable [[w:en:Iconoscope|iconoscope]] cameras are being used to transmit the program, along with overhead ceiling lighting.  The boom mike makes an appearance here-it was not frequently needed in radio, but became a staple of television audio.
