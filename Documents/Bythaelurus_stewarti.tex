Bythaelurus stewarti, the Error Seamount catshark, is a catshark of the
family Scyliorhinidae in the order Carchariniformes. It is endemic to
Error Seamount, a guyot located in the Arabian Sea in the western Indian
Ocean. Its closest relative is the bristly catshark (B. hispidus), which
it differs from in its larger size, darker and more mottled coloration,
and especially its smaller and less densely concentrated denticles.
