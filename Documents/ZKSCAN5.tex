Zinc finger protein with KRAB and SCAN domains 5 is a protein that in
humans is encoded by the ZKSCAN5 gene.

This gene encodes a zinc finger protein of the Krüppel family. The
protein contains a SCAN box and a KRAB A domain. A similar protein in
mouse is differentially expressed in spermatogenesis. Two alternatively
spliced transcript variants differing only in the five prime
untranslated region (5' UTR) have been described. Additional variants
have been found, but their full-length sequences have not been
determined.
