  {{Information
  |Description = {{en|1=A test model of the Orion spacecraft with its parachutes was tested the skies high above the U.S. Army's Proving Grounds in Yuma, Ariz. on Feb. 29, 2012. This particular drop test examined the wake - or the disturbance of the air flow behind Orion - that is caused by the spacecraft.
  
  The Orion spacecraft will replace the space shuttle as NASA's vehicle for human space exploration and is designed to accommodate four to six astronauts on deep space missions. It also could supplement commercial and international partner transportation services to the International Space Station.
  
  The Space Launch System, or SLS, is the heavy lift rocket that will carry the Orion spacecraft into space providing an entirely new capability for human exploration beyond low-Earth orbit.}}

  |Description={{en|1=The X-38 research vehicle drops away from NASA's B-52 mothership immediately after being released from the B-52's wing pylon.
  
  More than 30 years earlier, this same B-52 launched the original lifting-body vehicles flight tested by NASA and the Air Force at what is now called the Dryden Flight Research Center and the Air Force Flight Test Center. NASA B-52 Tail Number 008 is an air launch carrier aircraft "mothership," as well as a research aircraft platform that has been used on a variety of research projects.}}

  {{en|The Space Shuttle prototype Enterprise flies free of NASA's 747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA) during one of five free flights carried out at the Dryden Flight Research Facility, Edwards, California in 1977 as part of the Shuttle program's Approach and Landing Tests (ALT). The tests were conducted to verify orbiter aerodynamics and handling characteristics in preparation for orbital flights with the Space Shuttle Columbia. A tail cone over the main engine area of Enterprise smoothed out turbulent airflow during flight. It was removed on the two last free flights to accurately check approach and landing characteristics.}}
