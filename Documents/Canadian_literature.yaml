  |Date=1945 <ref><small>Note: Although this photo is said to be from 1945 in some sources, François Ricard, specialist of Roy's work and life, writes in ''Album Gabrielle Roy'' (Boréal, 2014) that this photo is part of a series likely taken in the winter of 1947 (whereas another of several series of photos the Zarov took of Roy over the years is from 1945). If this photo is from 1947, it might not be in the public domain in the United States (see [[Template:Not-PD-US-URAA]]), although it would be in the public domain in Canada.</small></ref>
