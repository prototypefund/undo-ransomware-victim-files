The wingspan is about 40Â mm. Adults are brown with an indistinct complex

Larvae feed on various Asteraceae species, including Ageratum
houstonianum, Bidens pilosa and Calendula officinalis. The young larvae
are smooth and green with a brown head. Later instars develop a purple

thin wavy white line along each side, and white spots. Pupation takes
place in the soil.\[citation needed\]
