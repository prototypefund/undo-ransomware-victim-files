Committee on Space Research
===========================

-   *The Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) was established by the
    International Council for Science (ICSU) in 1958.*

-   *Among COSPAR's objectives are the promotion of scientific research
    in space on an international level, with emphasis on the free
    exchange of results, information, and opinions, and providing a
    forum, open to all scientists, for the discussion of problems that

The Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) was established by the
International Council for Science (ICSU) in 1958.

Among COSPAR's objectives are the promotion of scientific research in
space on an international level, with emphasis on the free exchange of
results, information, and opinions, and providing a forum, open to all
scientists, for the discussion of problems that may affect space
research. These objectives are achieved through the organization of
symposia, publication, and other means.\
COSPAR has created a number of research programmes on different topics,
a few in cooperation with other scientific Unions. The long-term project
COSPAR international reference atmosphere started in 1960; since then it
has produced several editions of the high-atmosphere code CIRA. The code
"IRI" of the URSI-COSPAR working group on the International Reference
Ionosphere was first edited in 1978 and is yearly updated.

General Assembly
================

-   *The 41st General Assembly in Istanbul was cancelled due to the 2016
    Turkish coup d'état attempt.*

-   *Every second year, COSPAR calls for a General Assembly (also called
    Scientific Assembly).*

Every second year, COSPAR calls for a General Assembly (also called
Scientific Assembly). These are conferences currently gathering more
than a thousand participating space researchers. The most recent
assemblies are listed in the table below. The 41st General Assembly in
Istanbul was cancelled due to the 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt.
