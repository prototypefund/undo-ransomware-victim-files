Hiroshi Nakamura (中村 宏, Nakamura Hiroshi, born September 20, 1932
Shizuoka Prefecture) is a Japanese artist who has worked in 'reportage'
and surrealist styles. Early works, like "Sunagawa No.5" (1955) and "The
Base," (1957) critiqued the U.S. military presence in Japan. The
protests represented in "Sunagawa No.5", the Sunagawa Struggle, were a
response to the planned expansion of Tachikawa Airfield. His later art
took a more surrealist turn, with common motifs being high school girls
and methods of locomotion, including planes and trains.
