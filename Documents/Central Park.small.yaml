  |description={{en|1=Unknown photographer (Scanned by Derzsi Elekes Andor). Size:  10  cm x 16 cm. On the back side, hand written: Central Park May 1940 (2). Dara: 12230, Courtesy of Derzsi Elekes Andor. Horseback riding has been a tradition in Central Park for 150 years, dating back to when the park was originally designed. There is some evidence that Central Park was originally meant to be seen from horseback. Trails such as the bridle path adjacent to the Reservoir are made of hard, packed dirt and are as perfect for horseback riding today as they were when the park opened.  From 1927 to 2007, the Claremont Riding Academy, built in 1892, operated in Central Park, giving reasonably-priced horseback rides to anyone who wanted them. However, over time, the bridle path became frequently filled with other park users and it became too difficult to safely navigate on horse. In 2007, the stable was forced to close, and with it the only vendor of horse transportation in the park. From 2007 to 2011, horseback riding was available from Riverdale Equestrian Center on a very limited basis. Private trail rides could only occur in the park by appointment.
