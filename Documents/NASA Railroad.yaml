  {{Information
  |Description={{en|1=At NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, NASA Railroad locomotive 3 has been repainted. The Railroad Operation and Maintenance Team at Kennedy completed the refurbishment of locomotive 3 in October. The 15-month process, including a new paint scheme, dealt with extensive corrosion to the locomotive because of Kennedy's proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. Locomotives 1 and 2 also will be refurbished eventually. The NASA Railroad locomotives are SW-1500 switch engines built by Electro Motive Diesel (EMD).}}
