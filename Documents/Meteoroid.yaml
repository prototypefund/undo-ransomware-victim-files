The wide end (open end) of the "carrot" is the location of hypervelocity entry into the 0.05 g/cc aerogel. As the particle is slowed by the aerogel the track narrows to a point. The 10 micron projectile is seen at the tip of the "carrot". See http://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/science/sd-particle.html.}}

  |description={{en|1=New Map Shows Frequency of Small Asteroid Impacts, Provides Clues on Larger Asteroid Population
  This diagram maps the data gathered from 1994-2013 on small asteroids impacting Earth's atmosphere
  
  IMAGE:<br>
  This diagram maps the data gathered from 1994-2013 on small asteroids impacting Earth's atmosphere to create very bright meteors, technically called "bolides" and commonly referred to as "fireballs".  Sizes of red dots (daytime impacts) and blue dots (nighttime impacts) are proportional to the optical radiated energy of impacts measured in billions of Joules (GJ) of energy, and show the location of impacts from objects about 1 meter (3 feet) to almost 20 meters (60 feet) in size.
  
  DESCRIPTION:<br>
  A map released today by NASA's Near Earth Object (NEO) Program reveals that small asteroids frequently enter and disintegrate in the Earth's atmosphere with random distribution around the globe. Released to the scientific community, the map visualizes data gathered by U.S. government sensors from 1994 to 2013. The data indicate that Earth's atmosphere was impacted by small asteroids, resulting in a bolide (or fireball), on 556 separate occasions in a 20-year period. Almost all asteroids of this size disintegrate in the atmosphere and are usually harmless. The notable exception was the Chelyabinsk event which was the largest asteroid to hit Earth in this period. The new data could help scientists better refine estimates of the distribution of the sizes of NEOs including larger ones that could pose a danger to Earth.
  
  Finding and characterizing hazardous asteroids to protect our home planet is a high priority for NASA. It is one of the reasons NASA has increased by a factor of 10 investments in asteroid detection, characterization and mitigation activities over the last five years. In addition, NASA has aggressively developed strategies and plans with its partners in the U.S. and abroad to detect, track and characterize NEOs. These activities also will help identify NEOs that might pose a risk of Earth impact, and further help inform developing options for planetary defense.
  
  The public can help participate in the hunt for potentially hazardous Near Earth Objects through the Asteroid Grand Challenge, which aims to create a plan to find all asteroid threats to human populations and know what to do about them. NASA is also pursuing an Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) which will identify, redirect and send astronauts to explore an asteroid. Among its many exploration goals, the mission could demonstrate basic planetary defense techniques for asteroid deflection.}}

  {{Information
  |Description = {{en|This picture is of the Alpha-[[Monoceros|Monocerotid]] meteor outburst in 1995. The [[:en:Perseid|Perseid]] meteor shower, usually the richest meteor shower of the year, peaks in August. Over the course of an hour, a person watching a clear sky from a dark location might see as many as 50-100 meteors. Meteors are actually pieces of rock that have broken off a [[comet]] and continue to orbit the Sun. The Earth travels through the comet debris in its orbit. As the small pieces enter the Earth's atmosphere, friction causes them to burn up.}}

Pour la durée d'une heure, une personne observant un ciel clair d'un emplacement sombre pourrait voir bien 50-100 météores. Les météores sont en réalité les pièces de roche (rock) d'une comète et continuent à l'orbite autour du Soleil. La Terre voyage par les débris de comète dans son orbite. Comme les petites pièces entrent dans l'Atmosphère de la terre, la friction cause qu'ils brûlent en haut.}}
