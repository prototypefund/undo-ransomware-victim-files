  Black lines mark troughs, notched lines mark scarp crests. The lineation circling unit ''mh'' has been nicknamed "The Road to Nowhere". The large crater ''lc'' is the "Maryland Crater" on Thule, and ''sp'' are smaller pits or craters. The areas labeled ''bm'' and ''dm'' are made of bright material and dark material, respectively. The magenta areas labeled ''pm'' are patterned material, while the green areas labeled ''rm'' are rough material, and the blue areas labeled ''um'' are undifferentiated material. The eight subunits of Ultima, labeled ''ma'' to ''mh'', are rolling topography units that might be smaller subunits of Ultima. (https://twitter.com/rnolter/status/1115010760315371521)

  |Description=''The Scale of the Heliosphere and Nearby Galactic Neighborhood''
  
  The solar system and its nearby galactic neighborhood are illustrated here on a logarithmic scale extending (from < 1 to) 1 million Astronomical Units (AU). Our Sun and its planets are shielded by a bubble of solar wind - the heliosphere - that is about 100 AU in size. The actual boundary between solar wind and interstellar plasma is called the heliopause. Beyond this bubble is a largely unknown region - the interstellar medium. Threaded through the boundaries of the heliosphere is the Kuiper Belt - the source of short-period comets. The nearest edge of the interstellar cloud that presently surrounds our solar system is thought to be several thousand AU away. The Oort Cloud is a spherical shell of comets extending from <10,000 to ~100,000 AU - the edge of our Sun's gravitational sphere of influence. Alpha-Centauri, the best known member of our nearest star system, lies well beyond at ~300,000 AU. Interstellar Probe is to be man's first spacecraft designed to exit the heliosphere and begin the exploration of the interstellar medium.

  |description    = {{en|1=Artist's interpretation depicting the new view [in light of data from the Voyager spacecraft as they passed the heliopause] of the heliosphere. The heliosheath is filled with “magnetic bubbles” (shown in the red pattern) that fill out the region behind the heliopause. In this new view, the heliopause is not a continuous shield that separates the solar domain from the interstellar medium, but a porous membrane with fingers and indentations.}}

  |Description={{en|1=Our solar journey through space is carrying us through a cluster of very low density interstellar clouds. Right now the Sun is inside of a cloud (Local cloud) that is so tenuous that the interstellar gas detected by IBEX is as sparse as a handful of air stretched over a column that is hundreds of light years long. These clouds are identified by their motions, indicated in this graphic with blue arrows.}}
