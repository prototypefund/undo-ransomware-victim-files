Ballot Access News is a United States-based monthly online and print
newsletter edited and published by Richard Winger of California, an
expert on ballot access law in the United States. Published since 1985,
the newsletter advocates "fair and equitable ballot access laws."

Ballot Access News reports on state and federal court decisions,
compares American ballot access laws to those of other democratic
nations, and documents the number of votes independent and minor party
candidates receive. The newsletter also records the activities of the
Coalition for Free and Open Elections, an interest group of minor party
members and others working together on ballot access law reform issues.
Further, the newsletter occasionally notes developments on the usage of
instant-runoff voting in the United States.
