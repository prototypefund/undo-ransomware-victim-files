<h1 id="history">History</h1>
<ul>
<li><p><em>In 2013, NOAA closed 600 weather stations.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>In 2007, NOAA celebrated 200 years of service in its role as successor to the United States Survey of the Coast.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>NOAA was established within the Department of Commerce via the Reorganization Plan No.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Weather Bureau of the United States, formed in 1870</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Another direct predecessor of NOAA was the Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA), into which several existing scientific agencies such as the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, the Weather Bureau and the uniformed Corps were absorbed in 1965.</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p>NOAA traces its history back to multiple agencies, some of which were among the oldest in the federal government:</p>
<p>United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, formed in 1807</p>
<p>Weather Bureau of the United States, formed in 1870</p>
<p>Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, formed in 1871 (research fleet only)</p>
<p>Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps, formed in 1917</p>
<p>Another direct predecessor of NOAA was the Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA), into which several existing scientific agencies such as the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, the Weather Bureau and the uniformed Corps were absorbed in 1965.</p>
<p>NOAA was established within the Department of Commerce via the Reorganization Plan No. 4 and formed on October 3, 1970 after U.S. President Richard Nixon proposed creating a new agency to serve a national need for &quot;better protection of life and property from natural hazards …for a better understanding of the total environment…[and] for exploration and development leading to the intelligent use of our marine resources.&quot;</p>
<p>In 2007, NOAA celebrated 200 years of service in its role as successor to the United States Survey of the Coast. In 2013, NOAA closed 600 weather stations.</p>

<p>The NOAA flag is a modification of the flag of one of its predecessor organizations, the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey. The Coast and Geodetic Survey's flag, authorized in 1899 and in use until 1970, was blue, with a white circle centered in it and a red triangle centered within the circle. It symbolized the use of triangulation in surveying, and was flown by ships of the Survey.[citation needed]</p>
<p>When NOAA was established in 1970 and the Coast and Geodetic Survey's assets became a part of NOAA, NOAA based its own flag on that of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The NOAA flag is in essence the Coast and Geodetic Survey flag, with the NOAA logo—a circle divided by the silhouette of a seabird into an upper dark blue and a lower light blue section, but with the &quot;NOAA&quot; legend omitted—centered within the red triangle. NOAA ships in commission display the NOAA flag; those with only one mast fly it immediately beneath the ship's commissioning pennant or the personal flag of a civilian official or flag officer if one is aboard the ship, while multimasted vessels fly it at the masthead of the forwardmost mast. NOAA ships fly the same ensign as United States Navy ships but fly the NOAA flag as a distinguishing mark to differentiate themselves from Navy ships.</p>
