<p>The United States Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) was established in 1995, at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia. The organization was originally known as the Commandant's Warfighting Laboratory.<br />
The warfighting lab is part of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) and its stated purpose is to improve current and future naval expeditionary warfare capabilities across the spectrum of conflict for current and future operating forces.</p>
<p>The organization is in charge of various aspects of advanced techniques and technology in the United States Marine Corps, and is also responsible for overseeing the Urban Warrior program. Recently the MCWL has been overseeing the testing and implementation of distributed operations at the behest of General James Amos, the former Commanding General of MCCDC.</p>
